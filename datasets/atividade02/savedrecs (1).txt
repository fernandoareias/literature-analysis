AB We evaluate three open source enterprise service buses (ESBs) Fuse, Mule and OpenESB, focusing on their support of high availability. Since high availability for the these ESBs relies on transactional Java messaging service (JMS) in a staged event driven architecture (SEDA), we review JMSs first. On this base, we evaluate and rate the ESBs on their support of both stateless and stateful services. We rated Fuse first, followed by Mule and OpenESB.

AB The goal of this paper is to present practical techniques for improving the scalability of a distributed objects architecture built around an event-driven paradigm and the evaluation of their effectiveness in the case of location systems. As a case study, the ABng location system constructed using a publisher/subscriber pattern over a CORBA compliant middleware is presented. The main contribution of this paper is the elaboration and evaluation of three main concepts that play a crucial role in improving the scalability of event-driven architectures: events dissemination quality of service, notification tree based events-routing, and transparent multicast event-channel notification service. The applicability and efficiency of these techniques have been verified in practice by the ABng system implementation and performance testing. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Modern web apps handle huge and increasing numbers of users and operations. A rise of event-driven architecture approach and message queue systems provide a new alternative to face this scenario evidencing the lack of quantitative measurements comparing performance and scalability between specific message queue products. This article proposes a prototype architecture applied in ZeroMQ and RabbitMQ, used for measure the impact of (1) the number of messages over performance, and (2) the numbers of consuming nodes over scalability. The results show that for both criteria, the degradation threshold of ZeroMQ is higher than RabbitMQ, thus more scalable and faster.

AB The need for intelligent resource management (IRM) spans across a multitude of applications. To address this requirement, we present EP-IRM, an event processing system recognising composite events given multiple sources of information in order to support IRM. EP-IRM has been deployed in two real-world applications. Moreover, with a small effort it may be used in a wide range of applications requiring IRM. We present an evaluation of the system, and discuss the lessons learnt during its development and deployment.

AB Previews research works focus in the separation of data processing issues, heavy database queries and stream data processing over high-data-rate (CEP). In many contexts high-rate data streams and database query processing work together, for information correlation, data merging, aggregation with big quantities of previous data. In our work we mention these as Stream-DB workloads. A solution for any database engine is to parallelize the load though many machines or cores. However nodes can still overload. We propose an automated method for scalability and balancing of Stream-DB workloads, called AuDy. This mechanism integrates overload (re) scheduling, automated elasticity, shedding policies, admission control and alerts when more resources are required, to provide total balanced operations avoiding overload problems.

AB Event-driven architecture (EDAs) improves scalability by combining stateless servers and asynchronous interactions. Models to predict the performance of pure EDA systems are relatively easy to make, systems with a combination of event-driven components and legacy components with blocking service requests (synchronous interactions) require special treatment. Layered queueing was developed for such systems, and this work describes a method for combining event-driven behaviour and synchronous behaviour in a layered queueing model. The performance constraints created by the legacy components can be explored to guide decisions regarding converting them, or reconfiguring them, when the system is scaled.

AB Message-oriented event-driven systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many industry domains including telecommunications, transportation and supply chain management. Applications in these areas typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To guarantee adequate quality-of-service, systems must be subjected to a rigorous performance and scalability analysis before they are put into production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling methodology for message-oriented event-driven systems in the context of a case study of a representative application in the supply chain management domain. The methodology, which is based on queueing Petri nets, provides a basis for performance analysis and capacity planning. We study a deployment of the SPECjms2007 standard benchmark on a leading commercial middleware platform. A detailed system model is built in a step-by-step fashion and then used to predict the system performance under various workload and configuration scenarios. After the case study, we present a set of generic performance modeling patterns that can be used as building blocks when modeling message-oriented event-driven systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and accuracy of the proposed modeling and prediction approach.

AB Cloud computing is a paradigm that aims to transform computer, storage and network resources into a utility. As more applications are deployed on cloud environments, one of the main requirements refers to efficient scalability during the application execution. In this paper we present two mechanisms that aim at addressing this requirement: an adaptable two layer monitoring mechanism and an event processing framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms through a set of experiments on a large scale multi-cloud facility. The latter poses challenges with respect to time-constrained execution of applications, since the aforementioned mechanisms need to collect and analyse information from geographically distributed sites, and trigger scaling decisions during the real-time application execution. The experimentation outcomes demonstrate the value of the presented mechanisms, both in terms of efficient scalability and with respect to the introduced overhead on the infrastructure.

AB Client-Server (C/S) application is always used in the existing Human Resource Management System (HRMS) as the system architecture, which has the problems of complex maintenance and poor compatibility; and cannot use professional database and development system, making the system development difficult and the data security low. To solve the above problems, the overall demand is analyzed, as well as feasibility and key technologies of the enterprise HRMS system. Then a HRMS is designed and developed, based on the user's key functional requirements and related technologies, which is reasonable and easy to maintain. The system is supported by Browser-Server (B/S) structure, with the current popular Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE) multi-level structure as the overall architecture. The mature Microsoft SQL Server 2008 introduced by Microsoft is used as the database platform. Combined with Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern, this system can be used by users without geographical restrictions and system maintenance. In this system, performance logic and business logic are separated, which makes it convenient for the development and maintenance of the system. The system mainly includes six modules: personnel management, organizational management, recruitment management, training management, salary management and system management, which integrates enterprise information and realizes the functions of easy access and easy query of information database. Its interface is simple, easy to understand, and easy to operate, with low investment, low cost, high safety, good performance and easy maintenance, which help to improve the work efficiency and modern management level of enterprises. In the end, the operation performance of the system is tested. The results show that the throughput of the main functional modules in the system is greater than 100 times/s when dealing with the business, and the success rate of event processing is greater than 99%. The average response time of the business end is less than 0.4 s, and the average response time of the terminal side is less than 0.5 s, which all meet the standards. System CPU occupancy rate can be basically controlled below 30%, and memory usage rate is below 30%. In summary, the system designed here has the basic functions but also to ensure good performance, suitable for enterprise personnel management, organizational management, recruitment management, training management and salary management. The design and development of this system aims to provide technical support for the service quality of enterprise human resource management business, to improve the overall efficiency, promote the pace of enterprise strategic development, and enhance the market competitiveness of enterprises.

AB Event processing engines are used in diverse mission-critical scenarios such as fraud detection, traffic monitoring, or intensive care units. However, these scenarios have very different operational requirements in terms of, e.g., types of events, queries/patterns complexity, throughput, latency and number of sources and sinks. What are the performance bottlenecks? Will performance degrade gracefully with increasing loads? In this paper we make a first attempt to answer these questions by running several micro-benchmarks on three different engines, while we vary query parameters like window size, window expiration type, predicate selectivity, and data values. We also perform some experiments to assess engines scalability with respect to number of queries and propose ways for evaluating their ability in adapting to changes in load conditions. Lastly, we show that similar queries have widely different performances on the same or different engines and that no engine dominates the other two in all scenarios.

AB With the ever increasing number of devices, nodes and the events they create, scalability and performance become important aspects for Operation Support Systems (OSS). One solution is to distribute the work load, i.e. 'cloudify' the formerly centralized monitoring and decision functions. This requires remodeling Complex Event Processing (monitoring) and Policies (decision making) towards a distributed yet coordinated system. This paper describes an extended architecture, implementation and performance tests for a policy-based event processing system. The main advantage of our approach is that we use policies for event pattern matching (an advanced form of Complex Event Processing) and for the selection of corrective actions (called Distributed Governance). Policies are (a) distributed (over multiple components) and (b) coordinated (using centralized authoring). The resulting system can deal with large numbers of incoming events, as is required in a telecommunication environment. Peak load will be well above 1 million events per second, combining different data sources of a mobile network. This paper presents the motivation for such a system, along with a comprehensive presentation of its design, implementation and evaluation.

AB The explosion in consumer devices has resulted in a significant increase in the number of mobile telecommunications nodes. As a result of increased device and node numbers, network operators have experienced a large increase in associated events. In such an environment, scalability and performance of event handling become important aspects for Operation Support Systems (OSS). A traditional approach has been to centralize monitoring and decision functions. The scale of events in a modern mobile telecommunications network means such centralized implementations are performance limited. What is required is a remodeling of Complex Event Processing (monitoring) and Policies (decision making) towards a distributed yet coordinated system. This paper describes an extensible architecture for such a distributed policy-based event processing system. Our approach provides a pluggable mechanism into which various event handling functionality can be integrated. In order to illustrate the applicability of our approach we evaluate the performance of 2 message queuing protocols; Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) based RabbitMQ and Java WebSockets. Our performance evaluation illustrates the ability of our architecture to transparently integrate alternative event processing technologies.

AB Performance and scalability of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) is often limited by fine-grain communication, especially in execution environments with high communication cost. However, the low cost of on-chip communication in emerging many-core processors offers a promise to substantially alleviate conventional PDES bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation and characterization of multi-threaded ROSS simulator on Intel's Knights Landing (KNL) processor. KNL is the second generation of the Intel Xeon Phi family of processors offering significant architecture improvements including 64 out-of-order multi-threaded cores, sharing of some levels of the cache hierarchy among the cores, fast 2D mesh interconnect network and the ability to reconfigure the processor to support various clustering modes.
   We analyze the performance and scalability of ROSS simulator on KNL processor under different thread counts, communication patterns, event processing granularities, synchronization periods, thread placement policies, and workload partitioning schemes. We conclude that within a single KNL processor, up to 2X performance improvement can be achieved compared to commodity Xeon multicore processors. We show that in most cases the performance of ROSS scales well with the best results achieved when thread affinity is assigned, CPU cores are evenly loaded, cache sharing is exploited and communication is limited to small clusters of cores.

AB Nowadays virtualization playing a vital role in the cloud technology. Users deploying websites on virtual private servers called instances which is cost effective and scalable. The explosive growth in World Wide Web, users are able to access things with any device at any time and any place. Increasing the access will constitutes the load and stresson the servers. Sometrics are useful to gauge the performance of various architectures. In this analysis we consider threematrices, they are responsiveness, scalability and efficiency. We have defined response time, memory usage and error rateas key factors for responsiveness, scalability and efficiency respectively. In this paper we investigate the performance of two web servers in different scenario, i.e. Apache - process-based webserver and Nginx - asymmetric mUlti-process event-driven architecture (AMPED). Our research shows that theNginx serveroutperformsApache server in terms of responsiveness and scalability, while Apache ensures the efficiency. The results are useful for those who want to host a website on virtual private server (VPS).

AB Software performance engineering is a mature field that offers methods to assess system performance. Process mining is a promising research field applied to gain insight on system processes. The interplay of these two fields opens promising applications in the industry. In this work, we report our experience applying a methodology, based on process mining techniques, for the performance assessment of a commercial data-intensive software application. The methodology has successfully assessed the scalability of future versions of this system. Moreover, it has identified bottlenecks components and replication needs for fulfilling business rules. The system, an integrated port operations management system, has been developed by PRODEVELOP, a medium-sized software enterprise with high expertise in geospatial technologies. The performance assessment has been carried out by a team composed by practitioners and researchers. Finally, the paper offers a deep discussion on the lessons learned during the experience, that will be useful for practitioners to adopt the methodology and for researcher to find new routes.

AB An essential requirement of large-scale event-driven systems is the real-time detection of complex patterns of events from a large number of basic events and derivation of higher-level events using complex event processing (CEP) mechanisms. Centralized CEP mechanisms are however not scalable and thus inappropriate for large-scale domains with many input events and complex patterns, rendering the horizontal scaling of CEP mechanisms a necessity. In this paper, we propose CCEP as a mechanism for clustering of heterogeneous CEP engines to provide horizontal scalability using adaptive load balancing. We experimentally compare the performance of CCEP with the performances of three CEP clustering mechanisms, namely VISIRI, SCTXPF, and RR. The results of experiments show that CCEP increases throughput by 40 percent and thus it is more scalable than the other three chosen mechanisms when the input event rate changes at runtime. Although CCEP increases the network utilization by about 40 percent, it keeps the load of the system two times more balanced and reduces the input event loss three times. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Event-driven architecture has been widely adopted in the software industry in recent years. This adoption is motivated by the increase in software modularity, and mainly the desired performance of decomposed monolithic applications. Although it has become popular, the current literature lacks studies that demonstrate the impact of event-driven architecture on performance. Hence, developers and architects end up adopting event-driven architecture without empirical evidence, but considering "expert advice."This study, therefore, reports an empirical study on the impact of the adoption of event-driven architecture on performance. For this, the performance of an application implemented with an event-based architecture was compared with the performance of the same application implemented using a monolithic architecture. The comparison was made using metrics such as CPU usage, memory, response time, throughput, and total packages sent and received. The results, supported by statistical tests, show that the monolithic architecture, compared to the event-driven architecture, consumes less computational resources and has better response times. Finally, this study reflects on the adoption of event-driven architecture, as well as points out challenges and implications that need to be considered by the scientific community in future research.

AB With rapid growth of world economy, the user activity in the capital markets is increased. This results into large number of transactional activities in trading systems. Hence, the trade surveillance system with low latency and high throughput is needed to monitor such a large amount of data in order to improve user experience by reducing discrepancies and frauds. In-memory technology reduces this latency by processing as well as caching data in main memory thereby removing the overhead of disk access. Currently, open-source frameworks such as Apache Ignite, Apache Flink and Kafka Streams provides in-memory streaming and caching functionalities along with scalability and fault-tolerant features. The paper talks about Trade Surveillance System (TSS), which includes Complex Event Processing (CEP). Here we discuss design, implementation and tuning of three different high-performance architectures for trade surveillance system using Ignite, Flink and Kafka Streams as in-memory streaming technologies. Paper also compares system throughput, support for fault tolerance and effect of caching on streaming throughput for all three architectures.
   Based on experiments, it is seen that Ignite outperforms Flink and Kafka Streams in CEP based streaming. Flink is more reliable considering fault-tolerance and event-time processing at streaming layer compared to Ignite. Though Kafka Streams also provides fault-tolerance and event-time processing out of the box, it shows high latency due to disk based processing.

AB Currently, many governments are gearing up to promote the development of smart cities in their countries. A smart city is an urban area using different types of sensors to collect data, which will then be used to manage assets and resources efficiently. Through smart technology, the quality of living and performance of urban services are enhanced. Recent works addressed a set of platforms aimed to support the development of smart city applications. It seems that most of them involved dealing with collecting, managing, analyzing, and correlating data to extract new information useful to a city, but they do not integrate a diversified set of services and react to events on the fly. Moreover, the application development facilities provided by them seem to be limited and might even increase the complexity of this task. We propose an event-based architecture with components that meet important requirements for smart city platforms, supporting increased demand for scalability, flexibility, and heterogeneity in event processing. We implement such architecture and data representation models, handling different data formats, and supporting a semantics-based data model. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of a S mart Event-based Middleware (SEMi) and present empirical results regarding a performance evaluation of SEMi.

AB In this paper, we conduct an experimental study of asynchronous invocation on the performance of client-server systems. Through extensive measurements of both realistic macroand micro-benchmarks, we show that servers with the asynchronous event-driven architecture may perform significantly worse than the thread-based version resulting from two non-trivial reasons. First, the traditional wisdom of one-event-one-handler event processing flow can create large amounts of intermediate context switches that significantly degrade the performance of an asynchronous server. Second, some runtime workload (e.g., response size) and network conditions (e.g., network latency) may cause significant negative performance impact on the asynchronous event-driven servers, but not on thread-based ones. We provide a hybrid solution by taking advantage of different asynchronous architectures to adapt to varying workload and network conditions. Our hybrid solution searches for the most efficient execution path for each client request based on the runtime request profiling and type checking. Our experimental results show that the hybrid solution outperforms all the other types of servers up to 19%similar to 90% on throughput, depending on specific workload and network conditions.

AB UNIX Internet servers with an event-driven architecture often perform poorly under real workloads, even if they perform well under laboratory benchmarking conditions. We investigated the poor performance of event-driven servers. We found that the delays typical in wide-area networks cause busy servers to manage a large number of simultaneous connections. We also observed that the select system call implementation in most UNIX kernels scales poorly with the number of connections being managed by a process. The UNIX algorithm for allocating file descriptors also scales poorly. These algorithmic problems lead directly to the poor performance of event-driven servers.
   We implemented scalable versions of the select system call and the descriptor allocation algorithm. This led to an improvement of up to 58% in Web proxy and Web server throughput, and dramatically improved the scalability of the system.

AB A new software technology for on-line performance analysis and the visualization of complex parallel and distributed systems is presented. Often heterogeneous, these systems need capabilities for the flexible integration and configuration of performance analysis and visualization. Our technology is based on an object-oriented framework for the rapid prototyping and development of distributable visual objects. The visual objects consist of two levels, a platform/device-specific low level and an analysis- and visualization-specific high level. We have developed a very high-level markup language called VOML and a compiler for the component-based development of high-level visual objects. The VOML is based on a software architecture for on-line event processing and performance visualization called EPIRA. The technology lends itself to constructing high-level visual objects from globally distributed component definitions. Details of the technology and tools used, as well as how an example visual object can be rapidly prototyped from several reusable components, are presented. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Event Processing (EP) systems are being progressively used in business critical applications in domains such as algorithmic trading, supply chain management, production monitoring, or fraud detection. To deal with high throughput and low response time requirements, these EP systems mainly use the CPU-RAM sub-system for data processing. However, as we show here, collected statistics on CPU usage or on CPU-RAM communication reveal that available systems are poorly optimized and grossly waste resources. In this paper we quantify some of these inefficiencies and propose cache-aware algorithms and changes on internal data structures to overcome them. We test the before and after system both at the microarchitecture and application level and show that: i) the changes improve microarchitecture metrics such as clocks-per-instruction, cache misses or TLB misses; ii) and that some of these improvements result in very high application level improvements such as a 44% improvement on stream-to-table joins with 6-fold reduction on memory consumption, and order-of-magnitude increase on throughput for moving aggregation operations.

AB The easy deployment of wireless sensors allows the development of context-aware applications that could react to the environment changes and users preferences. For example, data extracted from mobile phones, IoT devices, and embedded computers in buses and taxis could be processed in real time to understand city dynamics. However, gathering and real-time processing of relevant data are still a challenging task. For instance, the high volume of streaming data requires real-time processing in order to generate immediate mitigation actions. Complex-event processing (CEP) techniques and predictive analytics have been recently proposed for analyzing streaming data in order to generate fast insights and then take suitable actions according to the situations' changes. These techniques could be also used to predict future situations and react to them properly before happening. The work presented in this paper focuses mainly on the performance evaluation of three CEP engines, CQELS, C-SPARQL, and ETALIS, that are widely used by researchers for linked stream data processing. Experiments have been conducted using two existing benchmarks, CityBench and SP(2)Bench. Several performance metrics have been evaluated to assess on their ability to process high streaming data using complex queries. Results are reported to show the efficiency and scalability of these CEP engines for both social-based data (SP(2)Bench) and physical-based data (CityBench). Reported results show that ETALIS outperforms CQELS and C-SPARQL in terms of throughput and memory utilization. ETALIS was integrated as a use case scenario for occupancy and air quality comfort in energy-efficient buildings. Results show the usefulness of CEP for real-time data processing and reasoning.

AB In the Internet of Things, heterogeneous and distributed streams of sensor events is a driver for context-aware behavior in intelligent environments. However, processing the event data usually cross-cuts the business logic of IoT applications and offering such reusable functionality as a service towards a variety of customers with different needs is often faced with scalability concerns. We present SAMURAI, a multi-tenant streaming context architecture that integrates and exposes well-known components for complex event processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, NoSQL persistence and in-memory data grids. SAMURAI pursues a twofold approach to achieve scalability: (1) distributed deployment with horizontal scalability, (2) shared resources through multitenancy. For the scenario used in the experimental evaluation of our architecture, the results show little overhead to support multi-tenancy, with near-linear scalability and flexible elasticity for deployment schemes with data partitioning per tenant.

ID REQUIREMENTS; AGE
AB Over the past decade intelligent environments have grown in sophistication. Many recent paradigm shifts - such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), e-health and telemedicine - envision large distributed networks of intelligent devices, applications and services that are sensitive to the presence of people and responsive to their needs. Cutting edge technologies will autonomously and collectively operate on a growing volume of information arriving at ever increasing velocities to transparently and non-intrusively support users during their activities. Especially the escalating variety of information that applications have to deal with is a non-trivial concern. Making sense out of heterogeneous and pervasive streams of sensor events to anticipate and address the needs of users is a ubiquitous challenge that many interactive context-aware applications in intelligent environments frequently face. Furthermore, software solutions that continuously interpret the tasks and contexts of a variety of individuals with different needs are often faced with scalability concerns.
   We present SAMURAI, a batch and streaming context architecture that integrates and exposes well-known components for complex event processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation. SAMURAI builds upon key concepts of the Lambda architecture and big data enabling technologies to achieve horizontal scalability and responsive interaction with its users. Two application cases validate the feasibility and performance of our context architecture, demonstrating near-linear scalability, flexible elasticity and smooth interaction capabilities.

AB Ubiquitous environments present a series of specific challenges which must be faced in order to obtain the full potential that this kind of environments can provide to assist human beings in many scenarios. Especially, it can be challenging to appropriately manage the context changes. This feature directly affects the availability of the services deployed in the system, among other quality features, and implies additional development efforts from software developers. Service replication models and techniques may help to improve service availability and strengthen the system, e.g., against node disconnections. However, it is necessary to provide SOA with self-adaptive capabilities in order to be able to address a highly dynamic environment, creating and deploying service replicas at run-time and on demand. In this work, an analysis of the main elements involved in the dynamic deployment of service replicas is presented and how they can be combined to provide a self-adaptive software architecture to properly support the software development and dynamic service deployment in ubiquitous environments.

AB Distributed event-sourced systems adopt a fairly new architectural style for data-intensive applications that maintains the full history of the application state. However, the performance implications of such systems are not yet well explored, let alone how the performance of these systems can be improved. A central issue is the lack of systematic performance engineering approaches that take into account the specific characteristics of these systems. To address this problem, we suggest a methodology for performance engineering and performance analysis of distributed event-sourced systems based on specific measurements and subsequent, targeted optimizations. The methodology blends in well into existing software engineering processes and helps developers to identify bottlenecks and to resolve performance issues. Using our structured approach, we improved an existing event-sourced system prototype and increased its performance considerably.

AB Background and Objectives: Cognitive approaches to social anxiety suggest that an excessive brooding about one's performance in a social situation (post-event processing; PEP) is involved in the maintenance of anxiety. To date, most studies investigating PEP were conducted in laboratory settings. The present study sought to replicate previous findings on predictors of PEP after a naturalistic social performance situation. Methods: Sixty-five students, who had to give an evaluated presentation for credits, completed measures of trait social anxiety. Immediately after their presentation, participants rated state anxiety and attentional focus during the presentation, and provided an overall evaluation of their performance. One week after the presentation, they rated PEP during the preceding week, and reappraised their performance. Results: Regression analyses demonstrated that the performance ratings after and self-focused attention during the presentation were unique predictors of PEP over and above the effects of trait and state anxiety. There was no evidence that PEP was associated with a biased recall of individual performance evaluations. Conclusions: The results support cognitive theories that emphasize the importance of negative self-perceptions in the development of social anxiety and related processes, and underline self-focused attention and self-evaluative processes as important targets during treatment.

AB The increasing requirements of intensive interoperaterbility among the distributed nodes desiderate the high performance network connections, owing to the substantial growth of cloud computing and datacenters. Network I/O virtualization aggregates the network resource and separates it into manageable parts for particular servers or devices, which provides effective consolidation and elastic management with high agility, flexibility and scalability as well as reduced cost and cabling. However, both network I/O virtualization aggregation and the increasing network speed incur higher traffic density, which generates a heavy system stress for I/O data moving and I/O event processing. Consequently, many researchers have dedicated to enhancing the system performance and alleviating the system overhead for high performance networking virtualization. This paper first elaborates the mainstreaming I/O virtualization methodologies, including device emulation, split-driver model and hardware assisted model. Then, the paper discusses and compares their specific advantages in addition to performance bottlenecks in practical utilities. This paper mainly focuses on the comprehensive survey of stateof-the-art approaches for performance optimizations and improvements as well as the portability management for network I/O virtualization. The approaches include various novel data delivery schemes, overhead mitigations for interrupt processing and adequate resource allocations for dynamic network states. Finally, we highlight the diversity of I/O virtualization besides the performance improvements in network virtualization infrastructure.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper presents a cross-layer reactive monitoring approach for Cloud computing environments. Based on complex event processing (CEP) methodology, our proposal monitors and analyzes performance metrics across Cloud layers to detect and repair performance-related problems. The approach utilizes novel CEP analysis rules and a new action manager framework. The proposed analysis rules are derived from a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between Cloud layers. The results of this study are used to reduce the number of monitored parameters, define the analysis rules and identify the causes of performance-related problems. Our novel action manager framework assigns a set of repair actions to each performance-related problem and checks the success of the applied action. The results of several experiments indicate that the time needed to fix a performance-related problem is reasonably short. They also show that the CPU overhead of using our approach is negligible. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate the merits of our approach in terms of speeding up the repair and reducing the number of triggered alarms compared to baseline methods.

AB Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technology combines the Service-Oriented Architecture, which is based on the request/response model, and the Event-Driven Architecture, which is based on the publish/subscribe model. It can satisfy the demand of loose couple communication and cooperation in the enterprise applications. However, existing ESB based systems can't process the complex events in the real-world applications very well. In this paper, we firstly give a complex event processing model based on the relational algebra, and then propose a complex event processing oriented enterprise service bus platform and a complex event stream processing engine, and give the main algorithms of complex event processing and their performance analysis. Experiments show that our platform performs much better than the existing ESB based systems in complex event processing.

TI Enabling Persistent Queries for Cross-Aggregate Performance Monitoring
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
DT Article
AB It is essential for distributed, data-intensive applications to monitor the performance of the underlying network, storage, and computational resources. Increasingly, distributed applications need performance information from multiple aggregates, and tools need to make real-time steering decisions based on the performance feedback. With increasing scale and complexity, the volume and velocity of monitoring data is increasing, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we have developed a persistent query agent (PQA) that provides real-time application and network performance feedback to clients/applications, thereby enabling dynamic adaptations. The PQA enables federated performance monitoring by interacting with multiple aggregates and performance monitoring sources. Using a publish-subscribe framework, it sends triggers asynchronously to applications/clients when relevant performance events occur. The applications/clients register their events of interest using declarative queries and get notified by the PQA. The PQA leverages a complex event processing (CEP) framework for managing and executing the queries expressed in a standard SQL-like query language. Instead of saving all monitoring data for future analysis, PQA observes performance event streams in real time, and runs continuous queries over streams of monitoring events. In this work, we present the design and architecture of the PQA, and describe some relevant use cases.

AB We present and evaluate a low-overhead approach for achieving high-availability in distributed event-processing middleware systems consisting of networks of stateful software components that communicate by either one-way (send) or two-way (call) messages. The approach is based on transparently augmenting each component to produce a deterministic component whose state can be recovered by checkpoint and replay. Determinism is achieved by augmenting messages with virtual times, and by scheduling message handling in virtual time order. Scheduling delays are reduced by computing virtual times with estimators: deterministic functions that approximate the expected real times of arrival. We describe our algorithms, show how Java components can be transparently augmented with checkpointing code and with good estimators, discuss how our deterministic runtime can be tuned to reduce overhead, and provide experimental results to measure the overhead of determinism relative to non-determinism.

AB Cloud computing is particulary well suited for applications with a variable workload such as, for example, complex-event processing (CEP) applications. Since these application experience variability in utilization of resources, they are calling for an infrastructure that can dynamically scale according to the application demand. Scalability is one of the major advantages offered by IaaS (Infrastructre-as-aService) clouds. This gives rise to the idea to deploy CEP CEP applications should be specifically designed for the cloud to benefit from its scalability. Thus, the problem is how to dynamically scale legacy and existing CEP application (which have been around for years) with little or no changes to the application coede.

AB Organizations are increasingly focused on using data to make their operational business processes more intelligent and reactive. Reactive performance monitoring consists of automating strategic decisions into rule-based actions when appropriate. Often there is a response gap, where there is unnecessary latency or missing detail, as the mapping between the strategic, the operational and the analytical is complex, labor intensive and not clearly defined. This paper presents an OLAP-modeled rule environment that leverages Complex Event Processing (CEP), multi-dimensionally modeled On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases and Business Process Management (BPM) to provide reactive performance monitoring. We use two case studies to evaluate our proposed architecture for an OLAP-modeled rule environment. The first case study prototyped the environment using IBM PMQ, while the second prototyped the environment using QuickForms and a custom-built OLAP rule engine. Predictive modeling, traditional rule engines, and our OLAP rule engine are compared in terms of their support for reactive performance monitoring.

AB The easy deployment of wireless sensors allows the development of context-aware applications that could react to the environment changes and users' preferences. For example, information extracted from data gathered using mobile phones and embedded computers in buses and taxis could be used to understand city dynamics in real-time and therefore take mitigation actions. However, gathering and real-time processing of relevant information is still a challenging task. Complex-event processing (CEP) techniques and predictive analytics have been recently proposed for analyzing streaming data in real-time in order to generate fast insights and then take suitable actions according to the environment changes. The work presented in this paper focuses mainly on the performance evaluation of three CEP engines widely used by researchers for semantic and physical streaming data processing. Experiments have been conducted using existing benchmark tools and results are reported to shed more light on the performance these engines for stream data processing.

   performance analysis
AB The scenario modeling method empowers building managers by enabling comprehensive performance analysis in commercial buildings, but is currently limited to data from the building management domain. This paper proposes that Linked Data and Complex Event Processing can form the basis of an interoperability approach that would help to overcome technical and conceptual barriers to cross-domain scenario modeling. In doing so, this paper illustrates the cross-domain potential of scenario modeling to leverage data from different information silos within organizations and demonstrates how to optimize the role of a building manager in the context of his or her organization. Widespread implementations of cross-domain scenario models require a solution that efficiently manages cross-domain data acquisition and post processing underpinned by the principles of linked data combined with complex event processing. An example implementation highlights the benefits of this new approach. Cross-domain scenario models enhance the role of the building manager within an organization and increase the importance of information communicated by building managers to other organizational stakeholders. In addition, new information presented to stakeholders such as facilities managers and financial controllers can help to identify areas of inefficiency while still maintaining building function and optimized energy consumption. Two key challenges to implementing cross-domain scenario modeling are: the data integration of the different domains' sources, and the need to process scenarios in real-time. This paper presents an implementation approach based on linked data to overcome interoperability issues, and Complex Event Processing to handle real-time scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB A key important issue for telecom management is the delay in comprehending network conditions. This delay harms precise network management activities because the amount of managed data required for performance management has been increasing due to emerging technology such as the virtualization tailoring dedicated network service for an enterprise. Hence, the increase in managed data is accelerating, and in future, we will see a fatal limitation of the current management approach. Timely monitoring of failure is increasingly valuable. To tackle this issue, a decentralized performance management system is assumed, and a real-time performance monitoring implemented inside distributed network devices is proposed. In the system the demonstration result shows that burst traffic was successfully detected at 250 millisecond intervals, and a detection resolution of its failure is significantly improved, compared with the conventional centralized management approach.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is considered as a promising technology for enabling the evolution of service-oriented enterprise systems towards operational aware systems. CEP effectively supports the implementation of "sense and respond" behaviours, as it enables to extract meaningful events from raw data streams originated by sensing infrastructures, for enterprise processes and applications consumption. This paper proposes a novel CEP engine conceived with ease of use, extensibility, portability, and scalability requirements in mind. More specifically, we propose a Lightweight Stage-based Event Processor (LiSEP) based on a layered architectural design. Thanks to the adoption of Staged Event-Driven Architecture principles, core event processing logic is decoupled from low-level thread management issues. This results in an easy-to-understand and extensible implementation while testing results show performance scalability. We report on the carrying out of a case study on dangerous goods monitoring in maritime transport. The objective of the case study is to develop a Proof of Concept application leveraging on LiSEP capabilities in sensor and RFID events processing for monitoring and alerting purposes.

DE Events Processing; Analytics; Rules; JSON; In-Memory Database
AB Web applications are increasingly built to target both desktop and mobile users. As a result, modern Web development infrastructure must be able to process large numbers of events (e.g., for location-based features) and support analytics over those events, with applications ranging from banking (e.g., fraud detection) to retail (e.g., just-in-time personalized promotions). We describe a system specifically designed for those applications, allowing high-throughput event processing along with analytics. Our main contribution is the design and implementation of an in-memory JSON store that can handle both events and analytics workloads. The store relies on the JSON model in order to serve data through a common Web API. Thanks to the flexibility of the JSON model, the store can integrate data from systems of record (e.g., customer profiles) with data transmitted between the server and a large number of clients (e.g., location-based events or transactions). The proposed store is built over a distributed, transactional, in-memory object cache for performance. Our experiments show that our implementation handles high throughput and low latency without sacrificing scalability.

AB To process big data in a cloud computing environment, a large scale of stream big data is one of the challenging issues. In particular, complex event processing is an emerging technology to handle massive events from multiple sources and process them in a near real time. In this paper, we analyze four performance-influencing factors on a virtualized event processing system: the number of query statements, garbage collection intervals, the quantity of virtual machine resources, and virtual CPU assignment types. In our experiments, we observe the performance effects of these performance parameters, by implementing and running an Esper-based event processing application on top of a Xen-based virtualized system. With experimental results, we analyze the memory consumption problem, and apply periodic garbage collection, to reduce unexpected memory consumption of JVM. Also, we analyze performance effects of the number of cores in a virtual machine (VM) and resource sharing among VMs. Under the virtualized environment in cloud computing infrastructure, one of the critical issues is the management of virtualized computing resources. Accordingly, we present the event processing performance on VMs as a function of virtual CPU assignment types and the number of VMs that share virtual CPUs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background and objectives: Cognitive-behavioral models highlight the conjoint roles of self-focused attention (SFA), post-event processing (PEP), and performance appraisals in the maintenance of social anxiety. SFA, PEP, and biased performance appraisals are related to social anxiety; however, limited research has examined how SFA affects information-processing following social events. The current study examined whether SFA affects the relationships between performance appraisals and PEP following a social event..
   Methods: 137 participants with high (n = 72) or low (n = 65) social anxiety were randomly assigned to conditions of high SFA or low SFA while engaging in a standardized social performance. Subsequent performance appraisals and PEP were measured.
   Results: Immediate performance appraisals were not affected by SFA. High levels of SFA led to a stronger, inverse relationship between immediate positive performance appraisals and subsequent negative PEP. High levels of SFA also led to a stronger, inverse relationship between negative PEP and changes in positive performance appraisals..
   Limitations: Future research should examine whether the current findings, which involved a standardized social performance event, extend to interaction events as well as in a clinical sample.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that SFA affects the processing of positive information following a social performance event. SFA is particularly important for understanding how negative PEP undermines positive performance appraisals.. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Today's fast, competitive and extremely volatile markets exert a great deal of pressure on businesses to react quicker against the changes, and sometimes even before the changes actually happen. A late action can potentially result in a legal compliance failure or violation of service level agreements (SLA's). A business analyst needs to be notified before these failures and violations occur. This paper proposes an approach that enables real-time and process-centric decision support in the form of performance prediction as an application of Event-Driven Business Process Management (EDBPM). The ability of simulations to produce future-events, which are of the same type like the live-events generated by the really executed business process, is utilised. Live-events and simulated future-events can therefore be treated by a Complex-Event Processing (CEP) engine in the same way and parameters representing the historic, current, and future performance of the business process can be easily computed.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) systems have gained significant importance in various domains, such as finance, logistics, and security, where the real-time analysis of event streams is crucial. However, as the volume and complexity of event data continue to grow, optimizing the performance of CEP systems becomes a critical challenge. This paper investigates the impact of indexing strategies on the performance of databases handling complex event processing. We propose a novel indexing technique, called Hierarchical Temporal Indexing (HTI), specifically designed for the efficient processing of complex event queries. HTI leverages the temporal nature of event data and employs a multi-level indexing approach to optimize query execution. By combining temporal indexing with spatial- and attribute-based indexing, HTI aims to accelerate the retrieval and processing of relevant events, thereby improving overall query performance. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of HTI by implementing complex event queries on various CEP systems with different indexing strategies. We conduct a comprehensive performance analysis, measuring the query execution times and resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.), and analyzing the execution plans and query optimization techniques employed by each system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HTI indexing strategy outperforms traditional indexing approaches, particularly for complex event queries involving temporal constraints and multi-dimensional event attributes. We provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each indexing strategy, identifying the factors that influence performance, such as data volume, query complexity, and event characteristics. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design and optimization of CEP systems, offering recommendations for indexing strategy selection based on the specific requirements and workload characteristics. Finally, we outline the potential limitations of our study and suggest future research directions in this domain.

TI PARS: A parallel model for scaled processing of complex events

DT Article
DE Complex event processing; Stateful operators; Scalability; Parallel
   model; Distributed processing; Data stream processing
AB The need for fast processing of high volume of event streams has triggered the deployment of parallel processing models and techniques for complex event processing. It is however hard to parallelize stateful operators, making the implementations of distributed complex event processing systems very challenging. A well-defined parallel processing model is a pre-requisite to the implementation of any high performance distributed complex event processing system. Most recent works use partition key or shared memory for parallelizing stateful operators but suffer from imbalanced distribution of keys and slow access time to shared memory. This paper proposes a new parallel model called PARS using three partitioning techniques to allow scalable processing of complex events without using partition key or shared memory. We define PARS formally and use this formalism to prove its soundness and completeness. To present a proof-of-concept and evaluate PARS, we use an event generator to simulate event sources and show significant improvement in system scalability. Compared to other works, we experience 10%-20% higher throughput in our experimental results. Our experiments demonstrate processing speeds of up to 5,200,000 complex event detection per second on a multi-machine cluster. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Post-event processing (PEP) refers to a prolonged and negative rumination following anxiety-provoking social events. Because PEP may maintain social anxiety over time, it is important to reduce this repetitive, negative thinking. Past research has shown that PEP can be reduced through self-compassion. As such, the primary purpose of the present study was to examine the circumstances under which self-compassion buffers against PEP. Given that PEP may be exacerbated by negative performance feedback, we examined whether self-compassion would buffer against PEP under these circumstances (i.e., receiving negative performance feedback). Participants (N=66) provided an impromptu speech and were randomly assigned to receive either positive or negative speech feedback. As expected, negative performance feedback led to significantly more PEP than positive feedback. However, whereas this effect was particularly pronounced amongst those low on self-compassion, there were no significant differences between conditions on PEP amongst those high on self-compassion. The findings from the present study suggest that trait self-compassion serves to limit PEP in situations where negative performance feedback is provided. This work builds on the benefits of self-compassion in the context of social stress.

AB Event-based Systems (EBS) are used to detect and analyze meaningful events in surveillance, sports, finances and many other areas. With rising data and event rates and with correlations among these events, sequential event processing becomes infeasible and needs to be distributed. Existing approaches cannot deal with the ubiquity of out-of-order event arrival that is introduced by network delays when distributing EBS. Order-less event processing may result in a system failure.
   We present a low-latency approach based on K-slack that achieves ordered event processing on high data rate sensor and event streams without a-priori knowledge. Slack buffers are dynamically adjusted to fit the disorder in the streams without using local or global clocks. The middleware transparently reorders the event input streams so that events can still be aggregated and processed to a granularity that satisfies the demands of the application. On a Realtime Locating System (RTLS) our system performs accurate low-latency event detection under the predominance of out-of-order event arrival and with a close to linear performance scale-up when the system is distributed over several threads and machines.

AB Server performance is one of the critical activities in the data grid environment. A large number of applications require access to huge volumes of data from grid servers, In this case, efficient, scalable and robust grid server which can deal with large file transfer concurrent is needed. In this paper, we analyze the bottleneck of our grid servers and introduce user-space I/O scheduling, zero copy and event-driven architecture in our grid server to improve the servers' performance. The user-space I/O scheduling can save almost 50% I/O time in a huge number of small files transfer. Grid servers can elimination CPU consumptions between kernel and user space by zero copy and cut 63% times for context switches. Event-driven architecture will save 30% CPU usage to reach the best performance by thread-driven architecture. Optimization method combination of these three above are used in our grid servers, the full-load throughput of our system is 30% more than traditional solutions and only 60% CPU consumed compared with traditional solutions.

AB Data streaming applications are an important class of data-intensive systems. Performance is an essential quality of such systems. It is, for example, expressed by the delay of analysis results or the utilization of system resources. Architecture-level decisions such as the configuration of sources, sinks and operations, their deployment or the choice of technology impact the performance. Current component-based performance prediction approaches cannot accurately predict the performance of those systems, because they do not support the metrics that are specific to data streaming applications and only approximate the behavior of data stream operations instead of expressing it explicitly. In particular, operations that group multiple data events and thus introduce timing dependencies between different calls to the system are not represented sufficiently. In this paper, we present an approach for modeling networks of data stream operations including their parameters with the goal of predicting the performance of the resulting composed data streaming application. The approach is based on a component-based performance model with queueing semantics for processing resources. Our evaluation shows that our model can more accurately express the behavior of the system, resulting in a more expressive performance model compared to a well-encapsulated component-based model without data stream operations.

AB While Complex Event Processing (CEP) constitutes a considerable portion of the so-called Big Data analytics, current CEP systems can only process data having a simple structure, and are otherwise limited in their ability to efficiently support complex continuous queries on structured or semistructured information. However, XML-like streams represent a very popular form of data exchange, comprising large portions of social network and RSS feeds, financial feeds, configuration files, and similar applications requiring advanced CEP queries. In this article, we present the XSeq language and system that support CEP on XML streams, via an extension of XPath that is both powerful and amenable to an efficient implementation. Specifically, the XSeq language extends XPath with natural operators to express sequential and Kleene-* patterns over XML streams, while remaining highly amenable to efficient execution. In fact, XSeq is designed to take full advantage of the recently proposed Visibly Pushdown Automata (VPA), where higher expressive power can be achieved without compromising the computationally attractive properties of finite state automata. Besides the efficiency and expressivity benefits, the choice of VPA as the underlying model also enables XSeq to go beyond XML streams and be easily applicable to any data with both sequential and hierarchical structures, including JSON messages, RNA sequences, and software traces. Therefore, we illustrate the XSeq's power for CEP applications through examples from different domains and provide formal results on its expressiveness and complexity. Finally, we present several optimization techniques for XSeq queries. Our extensive experiments indicate that XSeq brings outstanding performance to CEP applications: two orders of magnitude improvement is obtained over the same queries executed in general-purpose XML engines.

AB For event-driven systems like automated manufacturing systems (AMSs), intelligent part dispatching, i.e., to assign various parts to proper processing routes, is crucial to gain high resource utilization and production efficiency. This work proposes an innovative dispatching mechanism, which can better these metrics by minimizing the cycle time, i.e., the mean time to produce a product, while avoiding any deadlock, i.e., no part can proceed due to circuit wait. Its prerequisite is liveness supervision; however, temporal information is associated to certain operation stages for the sake of performance evaluation and throughput maximization, i.e., to maximize the finished-part quantity per time unit. In the paradigm of Petri nets, we show the criticality to prioritize certain activities locally. Our method can well design ratio parameters among distinct processes to improve system productivity.

AB This paper presents a performance-regulation method for a class of stochastic timed event-driven systems aimed at output tracking of a given reference setpoint. The systems are either Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS) such as queueing networks or Petri nets, or Hybrid Systems (HS) with time-driven dynamics and event-driven dynamics, like fluid queues and hybrid Petri nets. The regulator, designed for simplicity and speed of computation, is comprised of a single integrator having a variable gain to ensure effective tracking under time-varying plants. The gain's computation is based on the Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) gradient of the plant function with respect to the control variable, and the resultant tracking can be quite robust with respect to modeling inaccuracies and gradient-estimation errors. The proposed technique is tested on examples taken from various application areas and modeled with different formalisms, including queueing models, Petri-net model of a production-inventory control system, and a stochastic DEDS model of a multicore chip control. Simulation results are presented in support of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) has quickly become a disruptive force reshaping how we live and work. Compared to the consumer Internet, the industrial IoT puts forward much higher performance requirements in terms of network and computing capacity. The industrial IoT system needs to process tons of data generated by millions of IoT sensors in real-time. Recently, with the advent of programmable network devices (e.g., SmartNIC, programmable switch), the in-network computing (INC) paradigm has received a large amount of attention. INC refers to offload application-specific tasks from end-host to network devices. Benefiting from the line-rate processing capacity of network devices, the INC paradigm presents superior performance in terms of high-throughput low-latency computing. Therefore, INC is considered a promising technique to meet performance requirements in the industrial IoT. However, while network devices are capable of performing application-specific tasks, they are still far from the universal computing platform. In this article, we propose an INC powered mobile edge architecture, where we offload lightweight critical tasks to the INC devices and leave the rest to the MEC. To identify critical tasks, we introduce the complex event processing (CEP) tool in our architecture. Also, we present two industrial IoT use cases to evaluate the feasibility of our architecture.

AB This paper is aimed at the application of Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) for prioritizing the factors associated with the performance evaluation of event-based information management system (EBIMS). The study identified thirteen such critical factors deciding the performance of Event-Based Information Systems. Literature review along with experts' opinions were collected to arrive at the final thirteen factors. In this paper, the authors have used Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach to interpret the interdependency among the selected factors. In addition, MICMAC (crossimpact matrix multiplication applied to classification) analysis is also performed to illustrate the relative driving and dependence power among the selected factors. This paper infers that event processing algorithm, data volume and quality, and hardware and software along with query complexity are the most dominating factors which have the highest driving power and the minimum dependence power as they drive other factors and sit at the top of the interpretive structure model.

AB Simulation is essential for understanding the performance and availability behavior of complex systems, but there are significant difficulties when trying to simulate systems with multiple components, which interact with asynchronous communication. A systematic process is needed, in order to cope with the complexity of asynchronous event processing and the failure semantics of the interacting components. We address this problem by introducing an approach that combines formal techniques for faithful representation of the complex system effects and a statistical analysis for simultaneously studying multiple simulation outcomes, in order to interpret them. Our process has been successfully applied to a synthetic workload for distributed transaction processing. We outline the steps followed towards generating a credible simulation model and subsequently we report and interpret the results of the applied statistical analysis. This serves as a proof of concept that the proposed simulation process can be also effective in other asynchronous system contexts, like for example distributed group communication systems, file systems and so on.

AB Event processing systems (EPS) analyze events in real-time to extract useful information that enhances value for the stakeholders. In order to extract relevant information from the stream of events, EPS's typically embed a rule-based system (RBS) that react to events as soon as they occur. The performance of RBS becomes even more important when the events processed are generated on the semantic web, where events and their metadata may originate from a variety of sources but at a very high rate, often in excess of 107 events per second. For such a system the most appropriate RBS's seem to be Drools and Jena both of which are open-source and are tailored for the Java programming language. In this paper we present the requirements and design of an EPS for the semantic web as required by the Air Force Research Lab, and analyze the performance of Drools and Jena for this EPS. We developed prototype systems using Drools and Jena, and stressed each system with streams of high speed events. Based on our study we conclude that while Drools is about 40% faster, Jena consumes about 15% less memory. We summarize the findings from our study and discuss scenarios when each of these RBS's might be more suitable.

ID FRAMEWORK; DESIGN
AB Monitoring the performances of a business process is a key issue in many organizations, especially when the process must comply with predefined performance constraints. In such a case, empowering the monitoring system with prediction capabilities would allow us to know in advance a constraint violation, and possibly trigger corrective measures to eventually prevent the violation. Despite the problem of making run-time predictions for a process, based on pre-mortem log data, is an active research topic in Process Mining, current predictive monitoring approaches in this field only support predictions at the level of a single process instance, whereas process performance constraints are often defined in an aggregated form, according to predefined time windows. Moreover, most of these approaches cannot work well on the traces of a lowly-structured business process when these traces do not refer to well-defined process tasks/activities. For such a challenging setting, we define an approach to the problem of predicting whether the process instances of a given (unfinished) time window will violate an aggregate performance requirement. The approach mainly rely on inducing and integrating two complementary predictive models: (1) a clustering-based predictor for estimating the outcome of each ongoing process instance, (2) a time-series predictor for estimating the performance outcome of "future" process instances that will fall in the window after the moment when the prediction is being made (i.e. instances, not started yet, that will start by the end of the window). Both models are expected to benefit from the availability of aggregate context data regarding the environment that surrounds the process. This discovery approach is conceived as the core of an advanced performance monitoring system, for which an event-based conceptual architecture is here proposed. Tests on real-life event data confirmed the validity of our approach, in terms of accuracy, robustness, scalability, and usability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enterprises have to be increasingly agile and responsive to address the challenges posed by the fast moving market. With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture (SOA), and the adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model and context serve as the solid basis for event processing; the rules, operators and keys of complex event processing are defined. Especially, workflow model is firstly used to extract complex event pattern. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the architecture, data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing. Complex event processing can improve operational performance and discover more actionable information, which is justified by application. Finally, lessons learned from the application are presented.

AB In this work in progress paper, we present our ongoing effort towards devising a priority based resource scheduling technique and framework for apache storm. Apache Storm is a popular distributed real time stream processing engine which has been widely adopted by key players in the industry including YAHOO and Twitter. An application running in storm is called a topology that is characterized by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To run multiple of such topologies in a storm cluster, storm provides with default, out of the box scheduler called Isolation Scheduler. Isolation Scheduler assigns resources to topologies based on static resource configuration and does not provide any means to prioritize topologies based on their varying business priority. As a result, performance degradation, even complete starvation of topologies with high business priority is possible when available cluster resources are insufficient. A priority based resource scheduling strategy is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem. A preliminary performance evaluation is performed to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed scheduler over the default storm Isolation Scheduler.

AB Complex Event processing (CEP) has emerged over the last ten years. CEP systems are outstanding in processing large amount of data and responding in a timely fashion. While CEP applications are fast growing, performance management in this area has not gain much attention. It is critical to meet the promised level of service for both system designers and users. In this paper, we present a benchmark for complex event processing systems: CEPBen. The CEPBen benchmark is designed to evaluate CEP functional behaviours, i.e., filtering, transformation and event pattern detection and provides a novel methodology of evaluating the performance of CEP systems. A performance study by running the CEPBen on Esper CEP engine is described and discussed. The results obtained from performance tests demonstrate the influences of CEP functional behaviours on the system performance.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) over event streams has become increasingly important for real-time applications ranging from health care, supply chain management to business intelligence. These monitoring applications submit complex queries to track sequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need for increasingly complex nested sequence query support arises, while the state-of-art CEP systems mostly support the execution of flat sequence queries only. To assure real-time responsiveness and scalability for pattern detection even on huge volume high-speed streams, efficient processing techniques must be designed. In this paper, we first analyze the prevailing nested pattern query processing strategy and identify several serious shortcomings. Not only are substantial subsequences first constructed just to be subsequently discarded, but also opportunities for shared execution of nested subexpressions are overlooked. As foundation, we introduce NEEL, a CEP query language for expressing nested CEP pattern queries composed of sequence, negation, AND and OR operators. To overcome deficiencies, we design rewriting rules for pushing negation into inner subexpressions. Next, we devise a normalization procedure that employs these rules for flattening a nested complex event expression. To conserve CPU and memory consumption, we propose several strategies for efficient shared processing of groups of normalized NEEL subexpressions. These strategies include prefix caching, suffix clustering and customized "bit-marking" execution strategies. We design an optimizer to partition the set of all CEP sub expressions in a NEEL normal form into groups, each of which can then be mapped to one of our shared execution operators. Lastly, we evaluate our technologies by conducting a performance study to assess the CPU processing time using real-world stock trades data. Our results confirm that our NEEL execution in many cases performs 100 fold faster than the traditional iterative nested execution strategy for real stock market query workloads.

AB Wireless communications play an important role in the mobile Internet of Things (IoT). For practical mobile communication systems,N-Nakagami fading channels are a better characterization thanN-Rayleigh and 2-Rayleigh fading channels. The average bit error probability (ABEP) is an important factor in the performance evaluation of mobile IoT systems. In this paper, cooperative communications is used to enhance the ABEP performance of mobile IoT systems using selection combining. To compute the ABEP, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the direct link and end-to-end link are considered. The probability density function (PDF) of these SNRs is derived, and this is used to derive the cumulative distribution function, which is used to derive closed-form ABEP expressions. The theoretical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation. The impact of fading and other parameters on the ABEP performance is examined. These results can be used to evaluate the performance of complex environments such as mobile IoT and other communication systems. To support active complex event processing in mobile IoT, it is important to predict the ABEP performance. Thus, a back-propagation (BP) neural network-based ABEP performance prediction algorithm is proposed. We use the theoretical results to generate training data. We test the extreme learning machine (ELM), linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and BP neural network methods. Compared to LR, SVM, and ELM methods, the simulation results verify that our method can consistently achieve higher ABEP performance prediction results.

AB This paper presents a transactional framework for low-latency, high-performance, concurrent; event processing in Java. At the heart of our framework lies Reflexes, a restricted programming model for highly responsive systems. A Reflex task is ail event processor that can run at a higher priority and preempt any other Java thread, including the garbage collector. It runs in an obstruction-free manner with time-oblivious code. We extend Reflexes with a publish/subscribe communication system, itself based on an optimistic transactional event processing scheme, that provides efficient coordination between time-critical, low-latency tasks. We report on the comparison with a commercial JVM, and show that it is possible for tasks to achieve 50 mu s response times with way less than 1% of the executions failing to meet their deadlines.

DE Microservices; REST; Event Driven Architecture
AB Most of the e-commerce companies are using microservices rather than monolithic architecture. Using microservices gives the ability of scalability and better fault tolerance. On the other hand, using microservices has some challenges, one of them is that communication between microservices must be efficient and robust. In this work, we focused on this challenge, analyzed the performance of communication techniques, and identified their advantages and disadvantages. We compared synchronous REST architecture and asynchronous event driven architecture.

DE SPECWeb 2009; Sugon cloud server; performance evaluation
AB Benchmark SpecWeb 2009 is usually adopted to measure the performance of server systems. Most of the submitted scores in SPEC official web site are measurements of single node servers. This paper proposes a method of running SpecWeb 2009 on a high-density and low-energy cloud server. The cloud server is a cluster of "big nodes", each of which has 8 computing modules containing 4 Intel Xeon D1500 processors connected with a 3D torus interconnect fabric. The official SPECWeb implementation consume too much resources, and that make the testing of a high-density cloud server very difficult. So we re-implement the SPECWeb 2009 client to an event-driven architecture. Our optimized version can simulate 50K concurrent user sessions. We also implement an event-driven web server, and it greatly improves the performance of SPECWeb server. In order to get the whole system score of SPECWeb in Sugon cloud cluster, the testing procedure is divided into 4 level tests. The lowest 4th level of test is taken on a single processor, then the 3rd level test performs on a computing module, and the 2nd level test runs on one big node, the 1st level test will perform on one half of the whole system scale. We have now tested SPECWeb 2009 on one processor, one computing module and one big node, and good scalability can be seen from the figures.

ID INTEGRATION
AB Enterprises have to be increasingly agile and responsive to address the challenges posed by the fast moving market. With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture, and the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model is put forth, and the rules are defined. To improve the detect efficiency, classification and partition of event instance is utilized. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm that is considered as one of the contributions. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing. Complex event processing can improve operation efficiency and discover more actionable information, which is justified by the application.

AB In today's world, complex global business environment is in a state of continuous change. Therefore, business organizations are looking for an innovative way to optimize and to support the performance of their business processes to meet out their market share in order to maintain a competitive edge. Usually, business processes are monitored in near real-time using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). KPI is in turn calculated from metrics from business processes. In the case of business outsourcing, the KPI calculation from the metrics of business process is to be carried out cutting across the inter-organizations boundaries and spanning multiple domains. This process poses several challenges in the computation of the KPIs. Some of these challenges include uncertainty in metric values, just-in-time KPI computation and scalability. To address the above challenges of business organizations, a four-tier Complex business Activity Monitoring system with Event Processing (CAMEP) is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAMEP method by comparing with the existing BAM approaches. The proposed CAMEP is also analysed using the ANOVA and T test.

AB This paper describes the architecture, prototype implementation and performance analysis of a complex event processing engine that can scale up to very large numbers of concurrent events while keeping the requirements on system resources predictable and low. The main innovation of this approach is that each instantiated event pattern is handled by a dedicated Erlang process, instead of a single or shared operating system thread. This in turn, reduces the latency in processing the event processing as it avoids the overheads associated with resource contention. We demonstrate how this approach can achieve linear event processing times under high event loads, using modest computing resources. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We present a new software technology for on-line performance analysis and visualization of complex parallel and distributed systems. Often heterogeneous, these systems need capabilities for flexible integration and configuration of performance analysis and visualization. Our technology is based on an object-oriented framework for rapid prototyping and development of distributable visual objects. The visual objects consist of two levels, a platform/device-specific low level, and an analysis- and visualization-specific high level. We have developed a very high-level, markup language, called VOML, and a compiler for component-based development of high-level visual objects. The VOML is based on a software architecture for on-line event processing and performance visualization called EPIRA. The technology lends itself to constructing high-level visual objects from globally distributed component definitions. We present details of the technology and tools used, and show how an example visual object can be rapidly prototyped from several reusable components.

AB Business Performance Management(BPM) is a newfi-ontier in IT-enabled enterprise that supports the monitoring business operations. BPM solutions must be able to efficiently process business events, compute business metrics, detect business situations, and provide the real-time visibility of key performance indicators (KPIs) in dynamic environments, wherein sources of dynamicity are plentiful, including new strategies, operations, KPIs, etc. Therefi)re, BPM solutions need to adapt these changes by dynamic evolution. We propose a policy-driven approach, where evolution policies capture the evolution mechanism of BPM solutions. Thisfirees solution developersfrom low-level programming concerns. We implementeda hybrid compilationinterpretation framework that enables execution of wide spectrums of evolution policies. Further ourframework enables execution qf evolution policies in parallel with on going event processing and guarantees the integrity on both of them.

TI ChronicleDB: A High-Performance Event Store
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS
DT Article
DE Event processing; indexing; aggregation queries; time travel queries;
   storage layout; recovery
AB Reactive security monitoring, self-driving cars, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other novel applications require systems for both writing events arriving at very high and fluctuating rates to persistent storage as well as supporting analytical ad hoc queries. As standard database systems are not capable of delivering the required write performance, log-based systems, key-value stores, and other write-optimized data stores have emerged recently. However, the drawbacks of these systems are a fair query performance and the lack of suitable instant recovery mechanisms in case of system failures.
   In this article, we present ChronicleDB, a novel database system with a storage layout tailored for high write performance under fluctuating data rates and powerful indexing capabilities to support a variety of queries. In addition, ChronicleDB offers low-cost fault tolerance and instant recovery within milliseconds. Unlike previous work, ChronicleDB is designed either as a serverless library to be tightly integrated in an application or as a standalone database server. Our results of an experimental evaluation with real and synthetic data reveal that ChronicleDB clearly outperforms competing systems with respect to both write and query performance.

AB Emerging paradigms of attack challenge enterprise cybersecurity with sophisticated custom-built tools, unpredictable patterns of exploitation, and an increasing ability to adapt to cyber defenses. As a result, organizations continue to experience incidents and suffer losses. The responsibility to respond to cybersecurity incidents lies with the incident response (IR) function. We argue that (1) organizations must develop 'agility' in their IR process to respond swiftly and efficiently to sophisticated and potent cyber threats, and (2) Real-time analytics (RTA) gives organizations a unique opportunity to drive their IR process in an agile manner by detecting cybersecurity incidents quickly and responding to them proactively. To better understand how organizations can use RTA to enable IR agility, we analyzed in-depth data from twenty expert interviews using a contingent resource-based view. The results informed a framework explaining how organizations enable agile characteristics (swiftness, flexibility, and innovation) in the IR process using the key features of the RTA capability (complex event processing, decision automation, and on-demand and continuous data analysis) to detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents as-they-occur which, in turn, improves their overall enterprise cybersecurity performance.

AB This paper describes the architecture, prototype implementation and performance analysis of a complex event processing engine that can meet soft real time constraints, and scale up to many thousands of concurrent events. We have avoided the resource overheads associated with the processing of large numbers of concurrent events (such as, for example, those generated by user sessions in a web site) by using lightweight Erlang processes and a 'shared nothing' architecture. We demonstrate how this approach can achieve predictable event processing times under varying loads, using only modest hardware resources in an SMP architecture.

AB Today, in the state of the art process engine solutions, process models are executed by a central orchestrator (i.e. one per process). There are however a lot of drawbacks in using a central coordinator, including a single point of failure and performance degradation. Decentralization algorithms that distribute the workload of the central orchestrator exist, but they still suffer from a tight coupling and therefore decreased scalability. In this paper, we aim to investigate the benefits of using an event driven architecture to support the communication in a decentralized orchestration. This accomplishes space and time decoupling of the process coordinators and hereby creates autonomous fine grained self-serving process engines. Benefits include an increased scalability and availability of the global process flow.

AB Quality of service in IP networks necessitates the use of performance management. As Internet continues to grow exponentially, a management system should be scalable in terms of network size, speed and number of customers subscribed to value-added services. This article proposes a flexible, scalable, self-adapting model for managing large-scale distributed network. In this model web services framework is used to build the software architecture and XML is used to build the data exchange interface. Policy-based hierarchical event-processing mechanism presented by this paper can efficiently balance the loads and improve the flexibility of the system. The prediction algorithm adopted by this model can predict the network performance more effectively and accurately.

AB Systems of systems (SoS) are large-scale systems composed of complex systems with difficult to predict emergent properties. One of the most significant challenges in the engineering of such systems is how to predict their non-functional properties such as performance, and more specifically, how to model non-functional properties when the overall system functionality is not available. In this paper, we define an approach to SoS performance prediction based on the modelling of system interactions and their impacts. We adopt an Event Driven Architecture to support this modelling, as it allows for more realistic and flexible performance simulation, which enables more accurate performance prediction. We introduce a generic architecture and present its instantiation in a software architecture for the performance prediction of defence SoS. Our architecture allows for loose coupling, interoperability, and adaptability and facilitates sustainable evolution of the performance model of the SoS.

TI Controller-proxy: Scaling network management for large-scale SDN

SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
DT Article

   path bottleneck; Performance
AB Software defined networking (SDN) decouples the control and data plane of a network, which then drastically increases its flexibility and programmability. In large-scale networks such as data center networks, the scalability of a network is often limited by the SDN control plane because of a high flow arrival rate and uneven hotspot distribution. The objective of this paper is to design new mechanisms that utilize the computing resources in switches to scale up the SDN control plane without sacrificing the advantages of SDN. For this purpose, we propose the controller-proxy method, in which the SDN control plane can dynamically delegate a part of the event-processing logic to switches and utilize the computing resources in switches instead of handling OpenFlow events in the controllers. Experimental results show that controller-proxy method can reduce the workload of the control plane and improve the scalability of SDN networks by relieving the control path bottleneck.

AB Socially anxious and control participants engaged in a social interaction with a confederate and then wrote about themselves or the other person (i.e., self-focused post-event processing [SF-PEP] vs. other-focused post-event processing [OF-PEP]) and completed several questionnaires. One week later, participants completed measures concerning their evaluation of their performance in the social interaction and the degree to which they engaged in post-event processing (PEP) during the week. Socially anxious individuals evaluated their performance in the social interaction more poorly than control participants, both immediately after and 1 week later. Socially anxious individuals assigned to the SF-PEP condition displayed fewer positive feelings about their performance compared to the socially anxious individuals in the OF-PEP condition as well as controls in either condition. Also, the trait tendency to engage in PEP moderated the effect of social anxiety on participants evaluation of their performance in the interaction, such that high socially anxious individuals with high trait PEP scores evaluated themselves in the interaction more negatively at the later assessment. These results suggest that PEP and other self-evaluative processes may perpetuate the cycle of social anxiety.

AB Modern particle physics produces volumes of experimental data that challenge any data processing system. To illustrate, the trigger system of the LHCb experiment at CERN must sustain a data rate of 4 TB/s, yet maintain real-time characteristics.
   In this work, we report on ELPACO, a distributed event processing platform for scientific data. Its key characteristics are excellent scalability and high resource efficiency. ELPACO inherits its favorable scalability from Apache Storm, which we used as a basis for our platform. For resource efficiency, we tailored ELPACO to Eriador, a parallel, ARM-based hardware substrate with excellent energy/performance characteristics.
   With experiments on realistic data, we confirm a linear scalability (throughput vs. core count) and a 2.5x improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing solutions.

AB High Energy Physics code has been known for making poor use of high performance computing architectures. Efforts in optimising HEP code on vector and RISC architectures have yield limited results and recent studies have shown that, on modern architectures, it achieves a performance between 10% and 50% of the peak one. Although several successful attempts have been made to port selected codes on GPUs, no major HEP code suite has a "High Performance" implementation. With LHC undergoing a major upgrade and a number of challenging experiments on the drawing board, HEP cannot any longer neglect the less-than-optimal performance of its code and it has to try making the best usage of the hardware. This activity is one of the foci of the SFT group at CERN, which hosts, among others, the Root and Geant4 project. The activity of the experiments is shared and coordinated via a Concurrency Forum, where the experience in optimising HEP code is presented and discussed. Another activity is the Geant-V project, centred on the development of a high-performance prototype for particle transport. Achieving a good concurrency level on the emerging parallel architectures without a complete redesign of the framework can only be done by parallelizing at event level, or with a much larger effort at track level. Apart the shareable data structures, this typically implies a multiplication factor in terms of memory consumption compared to the single threaded version, together with sub-optimal handling of event processing tails. Besides this, the low level instruction pipelining of modern processors cannot be used efficiently to speedup the program. We have implemented a framework that allows scheduling vectors of particles to an arbitrary number of computing resources in a fine grain parallel approach. The talk will review the current optimisation activities within the SFT group with a particular emphasis on the development perspectives towards a simulation framework able to profit best from the recent technology evolution in computing.

TI Kerberos: A real-time fraud detection system for IMS-enabled VoIP

DT Article
DE Fraud detection; VoIP; IMS networks; Complex event processing;
   Scalability
AB In this paper we present the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of Kerberos, an architecture for the detection of frauds in current generation Voice over IF (VoIP) networks. Kerberos is fed by an On-line Charging System (OCS) generating events associated with the setup, evolution and tear-down of end-user calls in a VoIP network compliant with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) specification. Such events are properly correlated in order to identify, in real-time, patterns associated with a fraudulent utilization of the Operator's resources. The detection phase can in turn trigger the subsequent remediation actions. Communication between the OCS and Kerberos is based on an asynchronous paradigm, whereas event correlation and analysis are effectively realized through a Complex Event Processing approach. The paper will shed light on both the design and the implementation of the system, whose performance is then evaluated by relying on a real-world dataset of Call Detail Record (CDR) events provided by Tiscali, a well known Operator.

AB With the rapid development of telecommunication technology, the scale of network grows larger and larger, and network management becomes more and more complicated because of the diversity of business. It is rather urgent to build a unified network management service platform to effectively integrate all the net-work management subsystems and supply the integrated service. In building such platform, one of the biggest challenges is how to process complex events. This paper proposes a new platform named Network Management Service Platform for Complex Event Processing (C-NMSP). We firstly present a complex event processing model based on the relational algebra, as well as the definition and description of C-NMSP based on Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), and then give the main algorithms of complex event processing and their performance analysis. Experiments results show that C-NMSP performs much better than the existing ESB based systems in complex event processing.

AB Event-driven systems are highly depending on the quality of detection and processing of events. Many of complex real-world events cannot be processed by the existing event processing systems because they are too complex to be understood and processed by the systems. Complex events can be inferred from raw primitive events based on their incoming sequence, their syntax and semantics. Usage of ontological background knowledge about events and their relationship to other non-event concepts can improve the quality of event processing. In this paper, we discuss the profits and problems of ontology developing and usage in the area of event processing and propose modular upper-level ontologies for semantic enabled complex event processing. We discuss, why the modularity is needed and how these ontologies should be modular build up based on ontology engineering aspects to be able to address scalability, expressiveness and reuse.

   Event Processing
AB Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are one of the most widely used technologies for computer security. Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level. We present an ontology-based approach to correlation, and describe how it can be implemented as a distributed, highly scalable system. The paper contains a thorough discussion of the key issues that we have addressed, and of the technological choices that we have made.

AB In cloud event processing, data generated at the edge is processed in real-time by cloud resources. Both distributed stream processing (DSP) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) have been proposed to implement such event processing applications. FaaS emphasizes fast development and easy operation, while DSP emphasizes efficient handling of large data volumes. Despite their architectural differences, both can be used to model and implement loosely-coupled job graphs.
   In this paper, we consider the selection of FaaS and DSP from a cost perspective. We implement stateless and stateful workflows from the Theodolite benchmarking suite using cloud FaaS and DSP. In an extensive evaluation, we show how application type, cloud service provider, and runtime environment can influence the cost of application deployments and derive decision guidelines for cloud engineers.

AB Despite predictions following from cognitive theories of anxiety, evidence for memory biases in social anxiety has been mixed. This study extends previous research by using stimuli relevant to participants' concerns and allowing time for post-event processing Participants high (n=42) or low (n=39) in social anxiety symptoms gave speeches and received standardized feedback on their and a confederate's performance Participants then took recognition and recall tests for the feedback immediately after it was given and after a two-day delay Results showed no recall biases However, the hypothesized recognition biases were found the high social anxiety group remembered the confederate's feedback more positively than their own, remembered their negative feedback as worse than the low group, and diminished positive feedback over time. Moreover, post-event processing mediated the relationship between social anxiety and memory for negative feedback Results suggest that biased recognition of social feedback is linked to social anxiety (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

   ETIOLOGY
AB Background: The cognitive theory of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that adults with SAD have a tendency to anticipate poor social performance and reflect negatively on their performance following a social event. While a number of studies with socially anxious adults have supported the role of poor performance anticipation and post-event rumination in SAD, to date, only a few studies have addressed whether this also applies to children with SAD.
   Methods: Children (7-12 years) diagnosed with SAD (n=40), other anxious children (n=40) and non-anxious children (n=34) were exposed to a social stressor speech task and their pre- and post-performance appraisals assessed, taking into account objective performance ratings.
   Results: Although observers rated some aspects of performance as significantly worse among children with SAD than children with other anxiety disorders, children with SAD were not more likely than their anxious or non-anxious peers to show a general bias in pre- or post-performance appraisals. Furthermore, children with SAD were just as likely as their anxious and non-anxious peers to recognize good performance but were more critical of themselves when their performance was poor.
   Limitations: The speech task did not involve a same-age peer. Participants were relatively affluent group of predominantly non-minority status. Specificity for SAD in relation to other anxiety disorders remains unclear.
   Conclusions: Focusing on counteracting pre- and post-event social performance appraisals may potentially be inappropriate for childhood SAD. Children with SAD might benefit from interventions that focus on helping them to become less critical of themselves after social interactions have not gone well.

AB The present study investigated whether post-event processing (PEP) involving mental imagery about a past speech is particularly detrimental for socially anxious individuals who are currently anticipating giving a speech. One hundred fourteen high and low socially anxious participants were told they would give a 5 min impromptu speech at the end of the experimental session. They were randomly assigned to one of three manipulation conditions: post-event processing about a past speech incorporating imagery (PEP-Imagery), semantic post-event processing about a past speech (PEP-Semantic), or a control condition, (n = 19 per experimental group, per condition [high vs low socially anxious]). After the condition inductions, individuals' anxiety, their predictions of performance in the anticipated speech, and their interpretations of other ambiguous social events were measured. Consistent with predictions, high socially anxious individuals in the PEP-Imagery condition displayed greater anxiety than individuals in the other conditions immediately following the induction and before the anticipated speech task. They also interpreted ambiguous social scenarios in a more socially anxious manner than socially anxious individuals in the control condition. High socially anxious individuals made more negative predictions about their upcoming speech performance than low anxious participants in all conditions. The impact of imagery during post-event processing in social anxiety and its implications are discussed.

AB Artificial Intelligence-based event recognition systems carry high potential for organisations to utilise their structured and unstructured data. The application of these systems as a backbone of decision support systems allows for effective and efficient information management. To sufficiently evaluate such kind of integrated systems recognising events for the benefit of decision makers, a holistic methodology is necessary. We propose a new methodology which complements existing approaches for technology-oriented verification and validation by user-oriented evaluation (user experience analysis). We illustrate the proposed methodology by evaluating EP-IRM, an event processing system for intelligent resource management. This case study shows that our methodology offers invaluable information about the performance and acceptance of an event-based decision support system.

AB Differences in the relative use of global and local information (seeing the forest vs. the trees) may explain why people with social anxiety often do not benefit from corrective feedback, even though they pay close attention to details in social situations. In the current study, participants high (n=43) or low (n=47) in social anxiety symptoms gave a series of brief speeches, and then self-rated their speaking performance on items reflecting global and local performance indicators (self-assessment) and also received standardized performance feedback from an experimenter. Participants then completed a questionnaire asking how they thought the experimenter would rate their performance based on the feedback provided (experimenter assessment). Participants completed the self- and experimenter assessments again after 3 days, in addition to a measure of postevent processing (repetitive negative thinking) about their speech performance. Results showed that, as hypothesized, the High SA group rated their performance more negatively than the Low SA group. Moreover, the High SA group's ratings of global aspects of their performance became relatively more negative over time, compared to their ratings of local aspects and the Low SA group's ratings. As expected, postevent processing mediated the relationship between social anxiety group status and worsening global performance evaluations. These findings point to a pattern of progressively more negative global evaluations over time for persons high in social anxiety.

AB The CORBA Event Service provides a flexible model for asynchronous communication among objects. However, the standard CORBA Event Service specification lacks important features required by real-time applications. For instance, operational flight programs for fighter aircraft have complex real-time processing requirements. This paper describes the design and performance of an object-oriented, real-time implementation of the CORBA Event Service that is designed to meet these requirements.
   This paper makes three contributions to the design and performance measurement of object-oriented real-time systems. First, it illustrates how to extend the CORBA Event Service so that it as suitable for real-time systems. These extensions support periodic rate-based event processing and efficient event filtering and correlation. Second, it describes how to develop object-oriented event dispatching and scheduling mechanisms that can provide real-time guarantees. Finally, the paper presents benchmarks that demonstrate the performance tradeoffs of alternative concurrent dispatching mechanisms for real-time Event Services.

AB Cloud computing and its computing as a utility paradigm offers on-demand resources, enabling its users to seamlessly adapt applications to the current demand. With its (virtually) unlimited elasticity, managing deployed applications becomes more and more complex raising the need for automation. Such autonomous systems leverage the importance to constantly monitor and analyse the deployed workload and the underlying infrastructure serving as knowledge-base for deriving corrective actions like scaling. Existing monitoring solutions, however are not designed to cope with a frequently changing topology. We propose a monitoring and event processing framework following a model-driven approach, that allows users to express i) the monitoring demand by directly referencing entities of the deployment context, ii) aggregate the monitoring data using mathematical expressions, iii) trigger and process events based on the monitoring data and finally iv) attach scalability rules to those events. We accompany the modelling language with a monitoring orchestration and distributed complex event processing framework, capable of enacting the model in a frequently changing multi-cloud infrastructure, considering cloud-specific aspects like communication costs.

AB This paper extends the methodology of analytic real-time analysis of distributed embedded systems towards merging and extracting sub-streams based on event type information. For example, one may first merge a set of given event streams, then process them jointly and finally decompose them into separate streams again. In other words, data streams can be hierarchically composed into higher level event streams and decomposed later on again. The proposed technique is strictly compositional, hence highly suited for being embedded into well known performance evaluation frameworks such as Symta/S and MPA (Modular Performance Analysis). It is based on a novel characterization of structured event streams which we denote as Event Count Curves. They characterize the structure of event streams in which the individual events belong to a finite number of classes. This new concept avoids the explicit maintenance of stream-individual information when routing a composed stream through a network of system components. Nevertheless it allows an arbitrary composition and decomposition of sub-streams at any stage of the distributed event processing. For evaluating our approach we analyze a realistic case-study and compare the obtained results with other existing techniques.

AB RDataFrame is ROOT's high-level interface for Python and C++ data analysis. Since it first became available, RDataFrame adoption has grown steadily and it is now poised to be a major component of analysis software pipelines for LHC Run 3 and beyond. Thanks to its design inspired by declarative programming principles, RDataFrame enables the development of high-performance, highly parallel analyses without requiring expert knowledge of multi-threading and I/O: user logic is expressed in terms of self-contained, small computation kernels tied together by a high-level API. This design completely decouples analysis logic from its actual execution, and opens several interesting avenues for workflow optimization. In particular, in this work we explore the benefits of moving internal data processing from an event-by-event to a bulk-by-bulk loop. This refactoring dramatically reduces the framework's runtime overheads; in collaboration with the I/O layer it improves data access patterns; it exposes information that optimizing compilers might use to auto-vectorize the invocation of user-defined computations; finally, while existing user-facing interfaces remain unaffected, it becomes possible to additionally offer interfaces that explicitly expose bulks of events, useful e.g. for the injection of GPU kernels into the analysis workflow. In order to inform similar future R&D, design challenges will be presented, as well as an investigation of the relevant time-memory trade-off backed by novel performance benchmarks.

AB This paper extends the methodology of analytic real-time analysis of distributed embedded systems towards merging and extracting sub-streams based on event type information. For example, one may first merge a set of given event streams, then process them jointly and finally decompose them into separate streams again. In other words, data streams can be hierarchically composed into higher level event streams and decomposed later on again. The proposed technique is strictly compositional, hence highly suited for being embedded into well known performance evaluation frameworks such as Symta/S and MPA (Modular Performance Analysis). It is based on a novel characterization of structured event streams which we denote as Event Count Curves. They characterize the structure of event streams in which the individual events belong to a finite number of classes. This new concept avoids the explicit maintenance of stream-individual information when routing a composed stream through a network of system components. Nevertheless it allows an arbitrary composition and decomposition of sub-streams at any stage of the distributed event processing. For evaluating our approach we analyze a realistic case-study and compare the obtained results with other existing techniques.

AB Using the power of high-performance computing together with the flexibility of loosely coupled event-driven software architectures provides a lot of benefits, especially when it comes to processing real-time data. This paper outlines the architecture of a general-purpose platform leveraging event-driven microservices architecture in combination with Event Sourcing and powerful High-Performance Computing core. The platform is aimed to software applications that process and analyze huge amount of data in a real-time or near-real-time fashion from a variety of sources, having as requirement downtime-less upgrade and scaling capabilities. The first-class citizens of this platform are applications in the domains of IoT, trading, meteorology and traffic control. The reference implementation of this platform used as a foundation for this research consists of two main components, the hardware based on Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner family and Kubernetes as main container orchestration solution leveraging both Xeon processors and coprocessors for maximum performance. On the application level, the platform uses Apache Kafka as Event Sourcing mechanism that allows treating the applications as state machines, providing capability to perform "step back in time" or "multi-window event processing." We present the architecture of the platform and initial experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

AB Monitoring of applications deployed to Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds is still an open problem. In this paper, we discuss an approach based on the complex event processing paradigm, which allows application developers to specify and monitor high-level application performance metrics. We use the case of a Web 2.0 sentiment analysis application to illustrate the limitations we currently experience with regard to cloud monitoring, and show how our approach allows for more expressive definitions of monitored metrics. Furthermore, we indicate how the higher-level metrics produced by our approach can be used to increase application elasticity in an existing cloud middleware.

This allows us to examine the limitations of the imaging system's performance due to degradation in the detector performance from light pile-up and deadtime from triggering and event processing. Comparisons of simulation results to measurements from the HEAD PENN-PET scanner have been performed to validate the Monte Carlo model. The model was then used to predict improvements in the high count rate performance of the HEAD PENN-PET scanner using different signal integration times, light response functions, and detectors.

AB Cognitive agents are typically utilized in autonomous systems for automated decision making. These systems interact in real time with their environment and are generally heavily power constrained. Thus, there is a strong need for a real time agent running on a low power computing platform. An autonomous agent reasons like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision-making. The agent examined is the Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture. Task allocation is one of most time consuming and power-hungry processes within the CECEP architecture. Task allocation is a combinatorial optimization problem in the field of operations research. In the CECEP architecture, the cognitive agent performs this task allocation. This paper examines the performance of two task allocation algorithms (the greedy algorithm and the auction algorithm) that have the potential to significantly reduce the power and energy required to perform this task. Thus, it may be possible to execute complex task allocation problems on custom, portable, low power devices.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an event processing paradigm capable of detecting patterns over streaming data in real-time. Presently, CEP systems have key challenges to preform matching over video streams due to their unstructured data model and complex video patterns which occurs over time and space. In this paper, I introduce the design, implementation and optimization of the proposed CEP framework, which enables the pattern detection over video streams. The work first proposes a Video Event Query Language (VEQL) motivated from current event query languages to write expressive video queries in CEP scenario. The query discusses how to write event query rules for video patterns and encapsulate them as high-level operators. To perform matching over VEQL queries, Video Event Knowledge Graph (VEKG) is proposed, which is a graph-based structured model of video streams. A complex event matcher is then presented which enable spatiotemporal pattern matching over videos using VEQL and VEKG constructs. Finally, three optimization strategies: state summarization, data-driven windows, and tuning deep model cascades are discussed to improve the CEP system performance which I intend to follow in my ongoing PhD research.

AB This paper proposes an architectural framework that able to take into account, in an asynchronous fashion. Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) supports request reply pattern, it not suits for the stop- start (asynchronous) communication. Therefore, in this paper we integrate the SOA with the Event Driven Architecture (EDA) in web service discovery. The critical problem of service discovery in application-oriented web service technologies is how to match the user request with the web service advertisement, efficiently and accurately as per the user requirements. To meliorate the accuracy and efficiency in WS-discovery, the Proficient Matchmaking Technique (PMT) has been proposed in EDSOA. The performance evaluation shows that performance of the proposed technique is aloft than the existing technique.

AB Background: Post-event processing (PEP) is defined as repetitive negative thinking following anxiety provoking social events. PEP is thought to maintain anxiety symptoms in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) but little is known about the specific factors that contribute to the maintenance of PEP.
   Aims: The current study investigated how perceptions of performance and positive metacognitive beliefs might contribute to the persistence of PEP.
   Method: Participants with SAD (n = 24) as well as anxious (n = 24) and healthy (n = 25) control participants completed a standardized social performance task in the lab. Their engagement in PEP and perceptions of performance were assessed in the week that followed.
   Results: Immediately following the social task, individuals with SAD rated their performance more negatively and endorsed a greater number of positive metacognitive beliefs about PEP than did participants in both control groups. Importantly, both metacognitive beliefs and initial negative self-ratings of performance mediated the relationship between group status and PEP in the days following the event.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with cognitive and metacognitive models of SAD and enhance our understanding of the cognitive processes which may function to initiate and maintain negative thinking patterns in SAD.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern data-centric flows in the telecommunications industry require real time analytical processing over a rapidly changing and large dataset. The traditional approach of separating OLTP and OLAP workloads cannot satisfy this requirement. Instead, a new class of integrated solutions for handling hybrid workloads is needed. This paper presents an industrial use case and a novel architecture that integrates key-value-based event processing and SQL-based analytical processing on the same distributed store while minimizing the total cost of ownership. Our approach combines several well-known techniques such as shared scans, delta processing, a PAX-fashioned storage layout, and an interleaving of scanning and delta merging in a completely new way. Performance experiments show that our system scales out linearly with the number of servers. For instance, our system sustains event streams of 100,000 events per second while simultaneously processing 100 ad-hoc analytical queries per second, using a cluster of 12 commodity servers. In doing so, our system meets all response time goals of our telecommunication customers; that is, 10 milliseconds per event and 100 milliseconds for an ad-hoc analytical query. Moreover, our system beats commercial competitors by a factor of 2.5 in analytical and two orders of magnitude in update performance.

AB Event Processing technologies are likely to play an increasingly important role in future IT systems due to the increasing demand for on-line analytical systems as well as big data processing applications. Event Processing is particularly suitable for those applications due to its active processing approach combined with scalability. Today's approaches for achieving scalability are however focused on rather static event stream partitioning mechanisms to allow parallelization. Such approaches are well suited as long as a feasible partitioning for all processing tasks can be found. However when such a scaling mechanism is faced with processing tasks with dynamically changing focus areas, no effective pre-determined partitioning can be found which massively hampers with the required scalability. This paper presents the first steps towards a focused processing framework to overcome these limitations.

AB Commodity hardware is going many-core. We might soon not be able to satisfy the job memory needs per core in the current single-core processing model in High Energy Physics. In addition, an ever increasing number of independent and incoherent jobs running on the same physical hardware not sharing resources might significantly affect processing performance. It will be essential to effectively utilize the multi-core architecture.
   CMS has incorporated support for multi-core processing in the event processing framework and the workload management system. Multi-core processing jobs share common data in memory, such us the code libraries, detector geometry and conditions data, resulting in a much lower memory usage than standard single-core independent jobs.
   Exploiting this new processing model requires a new model in computing resource allocation, departing from the standard single-core allocation for a job. The experiment job management system needs to have control over a larger quantum of resource since multi-core aware jobs require the scheduling of multiples cores simultaneously. CMS is exploring the approach of using whole nodes as unit in the workload management system where all cores of a node are allocated to a multi-core job. Whole-node scheduling allows for optimization of the data/workflow management (e.g. I/O caching, local merging) but efficient utilization of all scheduled cores is challenging. Dedicated whole-node queues have been setup at all Tier-1 centers for exploring multi-core processing workflows in CMS.
   We present the evaluation of the performance scheduling and executing multi-core workflows in whole-node queues compared to the standard single-core processing workflows.

AB This paper presents the selection of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to improve the awareness of different manufacturing assets, including those related to energy efficiency. The implementation relies on Service Oriented Architecture deployed by Web Services and the further processing of the generated events by the application of an Event Processing Language based on rules. The proposed approach is illustrated with the implementation on a multi robot production line.

DE CEP; Event processing; Load distribution; Scalability; Big-data
AB Owing to Big Data popularity, the metrics Variety, Volume and Velocity (V3), are gaining importance in large scale data intensive applications. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an efficient solution for identifying events of interest on data streams arriving from geographically distributed heterogeneous sources in near-real time. CEP is capable of handling large variety of data with high computational velocity and delivers better solution compared to other existing techniques. However, handling large volume data streams still poses challenge in CEP systems. Hence, a middleware is required to manage huge streams of data on scalable distributed environment. This paper proposes Scalable Complex Event Processing (SCALACEP) framework for managing voluminous data streams. This paper addresses challenges such as state management and efficient rule distribution for design of distributed framework for CEP using the proposed SCALACEP. This paper also proposes a novel way of indexing CEP rules based on Geometric series. The proposed indexing is used for CEP Rule allocation and CEP rule pruning in the SCALACEP system. SCALACEP is evaluated and compared with other existing systems in the constrained virtualized environment and found to give better results in terms of throughput and reduction in Latency and Multicast.

AB Multithreaded sensor operating systems provide the paradigm of threads which enables programmers to program and maintain their applications more easily. However, a lot of memory space can be wasted due to the fact that a fixed-size stack is allocated for each thread. In this paper, we propose the shared-stack cooperative threads which can combine the simplicity of the multithreaded programming with the performance and scalability of event-driven systems. Our experimental results show that shared-stack cooperative threads utilize memory space more efficiently with some affordable context switching overhead for threading while providing programmers with the ease of multithreaded programming.

AB The current methods for measuring swimmer performance are time consuming and require substantial manual interaction. Inevitably, such techniques are prone to error or require a large amount of post-event processing. The aim of the research outlined in this paper is to design a novel performance analysis tool to monitor and measure swimmer performance using wireless technology previously developed at Loughborough University and determine how to communicate these data effectively to the coach in real time. The overall system effectiveness is reliant upon effective data collection, storage, and analysis. Providing the functionality to design an effective system requires robust technology, appropriate structures in persistent storage, and interface design to communicate the capability set to the user.
   This paper is focused on the development of a graphical user interface (GUI); a type of human-machine interface (HMI), to support users within the swimming domain. The computer integrated manufacture open system architecture (CIMOSA), generally applied as a form of business process modelling, has been used to structure the development of a user-centric, real-time monitoring system that supports the needs of the coaches, sports scientists, and swimmers. A methodology that uses the CIMOSA reference architecture as the foundation has been proposed and implemented to create a user-driven GUI that accommodates variation in requirements of user types in the swimming domain to optimize the performance analysis methods.

AB Choosing the appropriate architecture for a big data project is not a straightforward task. The architect needs to have knowledge in the problem domain, future application requirements, big data technology landscape and architectural patterns. Today's dynamic business environment enforces constantly evolving big data applications, which often need to process thousands of messages per second. Solutions implementing microservices and Event Driven Architecture (EDA) could provide scalability and extensibility to the required application. The article will outline microservices and EDA challenges, advantages and potential problems concerning big data stream processing.

TI ParaFlow: Fine-grained parallel SDN controller for large-scale networks

   parallelism; Event-based programming
AB Using Software-Defined Networking (SDN), the flexibility and programmability of networks can be significantly increased through the decoupling of the control and data planes. However, network scale-up in large-scale data centers can rapidly increase the computational complexity of operations such as the shortest path calculation on the network topology or Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing, which, in turn, can cause scalability problems in current SDN controllers. This paper proposes ParaFlow, a multithreaded SDN controller that supports fine-grained parallelism by exploiting application parallelism and utilizing multi-/many-core resources to accelerate event processing. ParaFlow also provides a flow-based programming interface that allows application developers to program with network flows rather than various types of low-level events. Experimental results show that ParaFlow achieves satisfactory performance and scalability in the multithreaded case.

TI RETRACTED: Dynamic Performance Analysis of STEP System in Internet of
   Vehicles Based on Queuing Theory (Retracted Article)
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
DT Article; Retracted Publication
AB The Internet of vehicles (IoV) is an important research area of the intelligent transportation systems using Internet of things theory. The complex event processing technology is a basic issue for processing the data stream in IoV. In recent years, many researchers process the temporal and spatial data flow by complex event processing technology. Spatial Temporal Event Processing (STEP) is a complex event query language focusing on the temporal and spatial data flow in Internet of vehicles. There are four processing models of the event stream processing system based on the complex event query language: finite automata model, matching tree model, directed acyclic graph model, and Petri net model. In addition, the worst-case response time of the event stream processing system is an important indicator of evaluating the performance of the system. Firstly, this paper proposed a core algorithm of the temporal and spatial event stream processing program based on STEP by Petri net model. Secondly, we proposed a novel method to estimate the worst-case response time of the event stream processing system, which is based on stochastic Petri net and queuing theory. Finally, through the simulation experiment based on queuing theory, this paper proves that the data stream processing system based on STEP has good dynamic performance in processing the spatiotemporal data stream in Internet of vehicles.

AB Cognitive models of social phobia (SP) assume that following social evaluative stress, individuals with SP engage into dysfunctional post-event processing (PEP), a detailed negative review of the past event. While previous research has already shown, that children with high levels of social fears suffer from more frequent negative PEP, it remains unclear how stable PEP is across time in this age group and whether it leads to degraded self-appraisals of performance. Therefore in the present study we exposed a group of high (HSA) and low socially anxious children (LSA; both n = 20), aged 10-12 years, to a social evaluative situation and assessed negative and positive PEP as well as self-rated performance at 2.5 h and one week after the task. Our results revealed that HSA children reported more negative PEP than LSA children, independent of levels of depression. Moreover, negative PEP was related to measures of social anxiety and performance ratings within the tasks. Only the performance ratings in HSA children worsened over the course of the following week and were related to more negative PEP. Thus, these results speak for the high clinical relevance dysfunctional PEP may have for the maintenance of social fears already in childhood. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), enormous events are produced by various kinds of devices at high speed. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is the key part of IoT middleware which can help the user to get semantic meanings of primitive events. Context-awareness is an important feature of CEP engine. In this paper a high performance context-aware CEP architecture and method is proposed for internet of things. Context is modeled as fuzzy ontology to support uncertainty and linguistic variables in event queries. Based on fuzzy ontology query and reasoning, complex event query plans are generated and context-aware queries are rewritten into context independent sub-queries. Data window is partitioned according to different event patterns and context. The subqueries are optimized and executed parallel based on data partition. The fundamental experiments show that this method can support fuzzy context in CEP and have acceptable performance and scalability.

AB The New Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T) is a digital engineering environment for enabling distributed space mission (DSM) technology demonstrations. Its event-driven architecture enables users to orchestrate DSM test campaigns by developing applications that communicate state changes via messages. NOS-T is motivated by requirements such as geographical distribution, cross-boundary participation, wide applicability, and usability that make it unique in this field. This article introduces NOS-T and describes its architecture in the context of an example DSM test suite, FireSat+. The scalability of NOS-T is demonstrated with a performance assessment of its capabilities under a stress test of high message frequency and payload size, which are both related to the complexity of potential user-generated test cases. Results show that message periodicity has no significant effect on median delay time over the ranges sampled; however, the message payload size induces linear growth in median delay time of approximately 1.5 ms per kB. Future NOS-T applications can adjust the execution time scaling factor and message payload size to match operational constraints on allowable delay.

AB We propose a run-time verification mechanism of things for self-healing capability in the Internet of Things domain. We discuss the software architecture of the proposed verification mechanism and its prototype implementations. To identify faulty running behavior of things, we utilize a complex event processing technique by applying rule-based pattern detection on the events generated real time. For events, we use a descriptor metadata of the measurements (such as CPU usage, memory usage, and bandwidth usage) taken from Internet of Things devices. To understand the usability and effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, we developed prototype applications using different event processing platforms. We test the prototype implementations for performance and scalability under increasing message rates. The results are promising because the processing overhead of the proposed verification mechanism is negligible.

AB APART (A Posteriori Active ReplicaTion) is a recently proposed active replication protocol specifically tailored for multi-tier data acquisition systems. It ensures consistency of middle-tier sink replicas by means of an a-posteriori synchronization phase based on reconciliation, which is activated only? in case replicas react to an input message from the sensors by generating an output event destined to the back-end tier.
   This paper enhances APART via a novel non-blocking synchronization scheme which prevents replicas from stalling while waiting for the outcome of an on-going synchronization phase. Contrarily, replicas are allowed to optimistically, process data from the sensors, and to immediately propagate any, output event towards the back-end tier The removal of the blocking synchronization phase from the critical path gives rise to striking performance gains via an effective overlapping of event processing and synchronization. On the other hand, system consistency is ensured by, enhancing the back-end tier synchronization logic in order to filter out optimistically produced output events that are incompatible with the reconciled state trajectory.

AB The emergence of Big Data has had profound impacts on how data are stored and processed. M technologies created to process continuous streams of data with low latency, Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Stream Processing (SP) have often been related to the Big Data velocity dimension and used in this context. Many modern CEP and SP systems leverage cloud environments to provide the low latency and scalability required by Big Data applications, yet validating these systems at the required scale is a research problem per se. Cloud computing simulators have been used as a tool to facilitate reproducible and repeatable experiments in clouds. Nevertheless, existing simulators are mostly based on simple application and simulation models that are not appropriate for CEP or for SP. This article presents CEPSim, a simulator for CEP and SP systems in cloud environments. CEPSim proposes a query model based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and introduces a simulation algorithm based on a novel abstraction called event sets. CEPSim is highly customizable and can be used to analyse the performance and scalability of user-defined queries and to evaluate the effects of various query processing strategies. Experimental results show that CEPSim can simulate existing systems in large Big Data scenarios with accuracy and precision. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Splitting a population into multiple instances is a technique used extensively in recent years to help improve the performance of nature-inspired optimization algorithms. Work on those populations can be done in parallel, and they can interact asynchronously, a fact that can be leveraged to create scalable implementations based on, among other methods, distributed, multi-threaded, parallel, and cloud-native computing. However, the design of these cloud-native, distributed, multi-population algorithms is not a trivial task. Using as a foundation monolithic (single-instance) solutions, adaptations at several levels, from the algorithmic to the functional, must be made to leverage the scalability, elasticity, (limited) fault-tolerance, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud systems while, at the same time, conserving the intended functionality. Instead of an evolutive approach, in this paper, we propose a cloud-native optimization framework created from scratch, that can include multiple (population-based) algorithms without increasing the number of parameters that need tuning. This solution goes beyond the current state of the art, since it can support different algorithms at the same time, work asynchronously, and also be readily deployable to any cloud platform. We evaluate this solution's performance and scalability, together with the effect other design parameters had on it, particularly the number and the size of populations with respect to problem size. The implemented platform is an excellent alternative for running locally or in the cloud, thus proving that cloud-native bioinspired algorithms perform better in their "natural" environment than other algorithms, and set a new baseline for scaling and performance of this kind of algorithms in the cloud.

DE Autonomous configuration; event-driven architecture (EDA); networked

ID SERVICE DISCOVERY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB The current trends in personalized products drive the paradigms of production systems toward autonomous networked manufacturing systems. This article proposes an ontology-based holonic event-driven architecture for implementing loosely coupled, holonic, autonomous distributed systems. The event-driven architecture (EDA) enables the services provided by different organizations and their suborganizations to be autonomously configured and integrated, while ensuring that the predefined organizational event access rules are compulsorily followed. This is realized by organizing the event services in a holonic manager and modeling the knowledge of services via the ontology developed in this study. The ontology model and the corresponding autonomous configuration mechanism are introduced. We developed a demonstration case to elaborate our approach and implemented a testbed using Java-based technology for testing the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and reliability of the proposed approach. Note to Practitioners-The ever-changing customer demands, the volatile market, and the trend of mass personalization require manufacturing systems to be smart in the event of uncertainties. To this end, information sharing in the supply chain is a key factor. However, there are several barriers in implementing a cross-organizational information system, including security, access privileges, and system interoperability. To lift these barriers, this article proposes an ontology model and a hierarchical EDA. Compared with conventional architectures, our approach facilitates the management of access privileges, integration of interorganizational information systems, and their interoperation. Moreover, our approach is competitive compared with the conventional service-oriented architecture in terms of both scalability and reliability of the system. Before the proposed approach can be practically applied, the ontology model needs to be further extended, and the event registration and message exchange protocol need to be standardized.

AB In this study, we introduce a big data processing framework that provides self-healing capability in the Internet of Things domain. We discuss the high-level architecture of this framework and its prototype implementation. To identify faulty conditions, we utilize a complex-event processing technique by applying a rule-based pattern-detection algorithm on the events generated real-time. For events, we use a descriptor metadata of the measurements (such as CPU usage, memory usage, bandwidth usage) taken from Internet of Things devices. To understand the usability and effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we test the prototype implementation for performance and scalability under increasing incoming message rates. The results are promising, because its processing overhead is negligible.

DT Article
DE Open architecture design; Common information model; Event driven
   architecture; Complex event processing
AB That the new generation power system control centers need a paradigm shift in their architectural design to meet new challenges, is an established conclusion of many researchers. However, literature on comprehensive architectural design towards this direction is scarce. In this paper, an information architecture design is proposed for the power system control centers. Appropriate adoption of open standards such as the common information model (CIM) is endorsed. Further, initial development of an event information model for modeling high level power system events is mentioned. Proposed architecture focuses on the desired features such as openness, interoperability, flexibility, scalability, vendor independence and event orientation. The architecture comprises services arranged in layers, viz., data integration and access, event processing and plug-in services. The details of this architecture along with the intricate relationships between various layers and services depicting how the technologies could be integrated into a coherent whole are described in this paper. An illustrative example, from the Indian power sector domain has been used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed architecture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solar-C is the third generation solar observatory led by JAXA. The accepted 'Plan-B' payload calls for a radiation-hard solar-staring photon-counting x-ray spectrometer. CMOS APS technology offers advantages over CCDs for such an application such as increased radiation hardness and high frame rate (instrument target of 1000 fps). Looking towards the solution of a bespoke CMOS APS, this paper reports the x-ray spectroscopy performance, concentrating on charge collection efficiency and split event analysis, of two baseline e2v CMOS APSs not designed for x-ray performance, the EV76C454 and the Ocean Colour Imager (OCI) test array. The EV76C454 is an industrial 5T APS designed for machine vision, available back and front illuminated. The OCI test arrays have varying pixel design across the chips, but are 4T, back illuminated and have thin low-resistivity and thick high-resistivity variants. The OCI test arrays' pixel variants allow understanding of how pixel design can affect x-ray performance.

DE Complex event processing; RFID; Smart hospital; Healthcare; Surgery
AB RFID technology has been examined in healthcare to support a variety of applications such as patient identification and monitoring, asset tracking, and patient-drug compliance. However, managing the large volume of RFID data and understanding them in the medical context present new challenges. One effective solution for dealing with these challenges is complex event processing (CEP), which can extract meaningful events for context-aware applications. In this paper, we propose a CEP framework to model surgical events and critical situations in an RFID-enabled hospital. We have implemented a prototype system with the proposed approach for surgical management and conducted performance evaluations to test its scalability and capability. Our study provides a feasible solution to improve patient safety and operational efficiency for an RFID-enabled hospital, by providing sense and response capability to detect medically significant events.

AB Enterprises in today's globalized world are compelled to react on threats and opportunities in a highly flexible manner. Due to technological advancements, real-time information availability, especially in manufacturing operations, has reached new dimensions and increasingly provides Big Data. With Complex Event Processing (CEP) the required technology to analyze and correlate heterogeneous event data is already available. Yet, these techniques are only scattered applied to Predictive Analytics, especially in the Event-driven Business Process Management domain. Most approaches are based on pure descriptive analytics not considering current context-situations appropriately. To enact a stronger situation-awareness, the paper at hand proposes the concept of event-based process predictions combining CEP with Predictive Analytics and outlines its potentials in particular for a proactive control of manufacturing processes.

AB Ether CAT is a popular Ethernet-based solution conceived for connecting devices at the shop floor in industrial environments. Even though it features very high communication efficiency, that permits thousands of I/O points to be periodically exchanged between controlling devices and decentralized periphery with cycle times well below lms, it is not able to cope in a proper way with event-driven systems, where lots of devices may be producing asynchronous information in a sporadic and unpredictable way.
   In this paper, some modifications to the basic EtherCAT protocol are proposed which enable CAN-like arbitrations to take place in such networks, so as to achieve a true priority-based access scheme.

DE real-time CORBA event systems; object-oriented middleware;
   publisher/subscriber architectural patterns
AB This paper makes four contributions to the design and evaluation of publisher/subscriber architectures for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) applications. First, it illustrates how a flexible publisher/subscriber architecture can be implemented using standard CORBA middleware. Second, it shows how to extend the standard CORBA publisher/subscriber architecture so it is suitable for DRE applications that require low latency and jitter, periodic rate-based event processing, and event filtering and correlation. Third, it explains how to address key performance-related design challenges faced when implementing a publisher/ subscriber architecture suitable for DRE applications. Finally, the paper presents benchmarks that empirically demonstrate the predictability, latency, and utilization of a widely used real-time CORBA publisher/subscriber architecture. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to strike an effective balance between architectural flexibility and real-time quality of service for important classes of DRE applications.

AB A considerable volume of data is collected from sensors today and needs to be processed in real time. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one of the most important techniques developed for this purpose. In CEP, each new sensor measurement is considered an event and new event types can be defined based on other events occurrence. There exists several open-source CEP implementations currently available, but all of them use orchestration to distribute event processing. This kind of architectural organization may harm system resilience, since it relies on a central core (i. e. the orchestrator). Any failures in the core might impact the whole system. Moreover, the core can become a bottleneck on system performance. In this work, a choreography-based microservices architecture is proposed for distributed CEP, in order to benefit from the low coupling and greater horizontal scalability this kind of architecture provides.

DE E-shopping; feedbacks; reputation; pricing; optimal dealer
AB Online shopping is an e-commerce model that enables the customers to buy and vend any products over the internet. There are ubiquitous WebPages that act as a third party dealer who intercede the buyer and the seller. This makes E-shopping customers to deviate from optimal shopping. A customer who seek to buy a product through e-shopping gives a visit to each site to ensure correct pricing and effective delivery. Each customer desires to buy a product from the consummate dealer, which is very tedious and time consuming. Thus to enhance online shopping, a new Dealer Identity in Online Shopping (DIOS) middleware architecture using complex event processing is designed. The time consumption in online shopping is reduced by the analysis of performance factors. The main intention of DIOS system is to provide the paramount dealers for proficient shopping. DIOS Middleware architecture redeems the optimal dealers to client by means of available criteria's like reputation and feedback. By the use of complex event processing, products pricings are serene from various dealer. The feedbacks parameters like cash on delivery, communications of the dealer, popularity, trustworthiness, quality of the product and delivery time, are unruffled from each buyer. On the basis of DIOS system, the optimal dealer is sorted out when pricing, feedback criteria and reputation parameters are met utterly.

AB In a system that enables real-time communication between groups of people via audio/video streams, a component called orchestration intelligently selects appropriate camera views for each participant individually, enabling larger setups and enhancing the social interaction itself. The Interaction Ontology (iO) receives low-level cue input from the audiovisual analysis component and informs the camera view switching component about the social interaction on a higher semantic level. The iO is a software component consisting of both a static ontology model and dynamic event processing logic. In this paper, we elaborate on the design rationale of the model and the intended dynamic behaviour of low-level cue processing. Finally we discuss performance and scalability issues, as well as alternative approaches to low-level event processing in such environments.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an emerging field in high performance computing paradigm where real time (low latency) computing capability is expected over big data processing (high throughput). Significant number of software architectures have been developed to improve the throughput while reduce the latency but maintaining of the both aspects reaches the limits of the software platforms. This paper proposes a novel custom hardware accelerator architecture framework for CEP in big data domain. The proposed design improves the throughput performance more than 10 times over the software counterpart while keeping the latency value at less than 100 nano seconds. Same Structured Query Language(SQL) type queries used in reference software architecture were used to improve the flexibility. A query compiler based on the same query language grammar was designed to convert the queries in to Hardware Description Language(HDL) modules. All modules were parameterized to improve the scalability of the design. Those generated modules were synthesized through vendor tools and programmed in to Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) platform in order to implement the system. Proposed hardware architecture framework was verified using a sensor network data set of a football field and the results were compared with software counterpart to show the performance improvement.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is concerned with real-time detection of complex events within multiple streams of atomic occurrences. Numerous approaches in CEP have been already proposed in the literature. In this paper, we examine the CEP Extension of ThingML which is a cross-platform modeling language for deploying Cyber Physical System (CPS). In particular, we focus on both language characteristic and performance of the ThingML Extension while processing CEP queries. Experiments show that although ThingML does not outperform other well-known CEP engines, it is still a potential CEP solution for CPS which has limited physical resources. In addition, ThingML also shows its efficiency in term of language expressiveness in comparison with State Machine based CEP queries.

ID UNCERTAINTY
AB Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space, time, and synchronization. However, another dimension of semantic coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event systems require a significant agreement between event producers and consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher. The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-k matchers along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95% F(1)Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.

AB We summarize results of the initial in-orbit performance of the pulse shape processor (PSP) of the soft x-ray spectrometer instrument onboard ASTRO-H (Hitomi). Event formats, kind of telemetry, and the pulse processing parameters are described, and the parameter settings in orbit are listed. PSP was powered-on two days after launch, and the event threshold was lowered in orbit. PSP worked fine in orbit, and there were no memory error nor SpaceWire communication error until the break-up of spacecraft. Time assignment, electrical crosstalk, and the event screening criteria are studied. It is confirmed that the event processing rate at 100% CPU load is similar to 200 c/s/array, compliant with the requirement on PSP.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) techniques have been used for business process (BP) monitoring of large organizations with high number of complex BPs and high rates of BP instance generations resulting in high number of monitoring rules and high rates of events. To circumvent the scale limitation of centralized CEP techniques, we present a decentralized CEP mechanism called dBPM that uses both task parallelism by decomposition and distribution of monitoring rules, and data parallelism by partitioning and dispatching of events. We show that dBPM is more scalable than a general distributed CEP mechanism, called VISIRI, by dynamically adapting to workload changes.

AB Event processing involves continuous evaluation of queries over streams of events. Response-time optimization is traditionally done over a fixed set of nodes and/or by using metrics measured at query-operator levels. Cloud computing makes it easy to acquire and release computing nodes as required. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a novel, queueing-theory-based approach for meeting specified response-time targets against fluctuating event arrival rates by drawing only the necessary amount of computing resources from a cloud platform. In the proposed approach, the entire processing engine of a distinct query is modelled as an atomic unit for predicting response times. Several such units hosted on a single node are modelled as a multiple class M/G/1 system. These aspects eliminate intrusive, low-level performance measurements at run-time, and also offer portability and scalability. Using model-based predictions, cloud resources are efficiently used to meet response-time targets. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through cloud-based experiments.

AB Cloud monitoring and analysis are challenging tasks that have recently been addressed by Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques. CEP systems can process many incoming event streams and execute continuously running queries to analyze the behavior of a Cloud. Based on a Cloud performance monitoring and analysis use case, this paper experimentally evaluates different CEP architectures in terms of precision, recall and other performance indicators. The results of the experimental comparison are used to propose a novel dynamic CEP architecture for Cloud monitoring and analysis. The novel dynamic CEP architecture is designed to dynamically switch between different centralized and distributed CEP architectures depending on the current machine load and network traffic conditions in the observed Cloud environment.

AB Event processing is one of the cornerstones to manage massive data streams in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Due to CPS applications' increasing complexity, detecting highly complicated events (aka. "expensive" events) leads to significant performance degradation, particularly harmful to mission-critical systems. To tackle this challenge, we define a new task - dynamic event processing offloading to CPS-edges. This paper proves the problem NP-hard and proposes a solution - DePo. DePo splits the expensive events into sub-models and offloads them to CPS edges. We design a long and short-term event memory mechanism in DePo that enables the edges and server to process expensive events collaboratively within their capabilities. Besides, we propose a concept called Edge Utility to measure the optimality of offloading schemes. A heuristic algorithm is presented in this study to guide how to dispatch events to edges, thereby helping DePo generate a sub-optimal solution in polynomial computational complexity. Our extensive experiments show that the performance gap between DePo and the optimal benchmark is less than 5%. DePo effectively reduces more than 40% redundant states and provides over 100% higher throughput than state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results verified the high stability and scalability of DePo, especially when dealing with a large number of expensive events.

ID CODE GENERATION
AB State machines are important behavioral models used in Model-Driven Development (MDD) of software applications. UML models are transformed into code and combined with a run-time library realizing state machine notions. Mapping of state machine concepts, including concurrent behavior issues, can be realized in various ways. We discuss several problems of call and time event processing and their impact of an application performance. In experiments, different solutions were evaluated and quantitatively compared. These variants were applied in refactoring of FXU - a framework for C# code generation and application development based on UML classes and state machine models.

AB The aim of this paper is to present, compare and contrast two different approaches that can be used to implement Event Sourcing which is at the core of modern reactive distributed applications. The paper commences with a brief overview of the relevant theoretical and implementational concepts, such as the event-driven architecture, Event Sourcing, CQRS, distributed logs and concurrency control. The following part of the paper presents the two proposed approaches: the first uses the Apache Kafka Streams API and the second uses the Microsoft Service Fabric Actor Services. The final part of the paper is devoted to the capabilities of the of the two approaches, focusing on the following aspects: communication mechanism, querying support, scalability, backpressure, and improvement potential.

AB Event-based systems follow a decoupled mode of interaction between event producers and consumers in space, time, and synchronization to enable scalability within distributed systems. We recognize a fourth dimension of coupling due to the need for mutual agreements on terms that describe event types, attributes, and values. Semantic coupling is challenging in large-scale, open, and heterogeneous environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). It requires event producers and consumers to agree on event semantics and can limit scalability due to the difficulties in establishing such agreements. In this paper we propose a new thematic event processing approach based on enhancing events and subscriptions with terms representing their themes to clarify their domains and meanings in addition to their payload. Experiments conducted using large heterogeneous sets of smart-city and energy management events suggest up to 85% of matching accuracy at a rate of 500 events/sec of throughput. This represents around 15% improvement in accuracy and 150% in throughput over non-thematic approaches. This suggests the viability of thematic event processing to scale to environments such as the IoT.

AB Nowadays, we see that the students who are educated on an e-learning platform demand features that will increase the satisfaction of the learning experience. In order to meet these demands, e-learning platforms need a) systems that can monitor students' behavior in real time through clickstream data, and b) generate instant actions for assisting / directing / informing students. Within the scope of this research, a method that can produce instant actions according to the students' behaviors is proposed in order to increase satisfaction in student experience by using methods such as streaming data processing and analysis and complex event processing. In order to demonstrate the usability of the proposed method, a prototype application has been developed for an e-learning platform providing online lectures in the field of financial sciences. Tests were performed on the developed prototype application in terms of performance and scalability. The results show that the proposed method gives successful results in determining student behaviors in real time and taking actions.

AB The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) standardizes the development of composite enterprise applications that make use of software components exposed as Web services. BPEL processes are currently executed by a centralized orchestration engine, in which issues such as scalability, platform heterogeneity, and division across administrative domains can be difficult to manage. We propose a distributed agent-based orchestration engine in which several lightweight agents execute a portion of the original business process and collaborate in order to execute the complete process. The complete set of standard BPEL activities are supported, and the transformations of several BPEL activities to the agent-based architecture are described. Evaluations of an implementation of this architecture demonstrate that agent-based execution scales better than a non-distributed approach, with at least 70% and 120% improvements in process execution time, and throughput, respectively, even with a large number of concurrent process instances. In addition, the distributed architecture successfully executes large processes that are shown to be infeasible to execute with a nondistributed engine.

AB The ATLAS High Level Trigger is a distributed real-time software system that performs the final online selection of events produced during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is designed as a two-stage event filter running on a farm of commodity PC hardware. Currently the system consists of about 850 multi-core processing nodes that will be extended incrementally following the increasing luminosity of the LHC to about 2000 nodes depending oil the evolution of file processor technology. Due to file complexity and similarity of the algorithms a large fraction of the software is shared between the online and offline event reconstruction. The HLT Infrastructure serves as file interface between the two domains and provides common services for the trigger algorithms. The consequences of this design choice will be discussed and experiences front the operation of the ATLAS HLT during cosmic ray data taking and first beam in 2008 will be presented. Since the event processing time at the HLT is directly related to the number of processing nodes required, special emphasis has to be put oil monitoring and improving the performance of the software. Both open-source as well as custom developed tools are used for this task and a few use-cases will be shown. Finally, the implications of file prevailing industry trend towards multi- and many-core processors for the architecture of the ATLAS HLT will be discussed. The use or multi-processing and multi-threading techniques within the current system will be presented. Several approaches to make optimal use of the increasing number of cores will be investigated and the practical implications of implementing each approach in the current system with hundreds of developers and several hundred thousand lines of code will be examined.

ID CHALLENGES
AB [Context] Data-intensive systems, a.k.a. big data systems (BDS), are software systems that handle a large volume of data in the presence of performance quality attributes, such as scalability and availability. Before the advent of big data management systems (e.g. Cassandra) and frameworks (e.g. Spark), organizations had to cope with large data volumes with custom-tailored solutions. In particular, a decade ago, Tecgraf/PUC-Rio developed a system to monitor truck fleet in real-time and proactively detect events from the positioning data received. Over the years, the system evolved into a complex and large obsolescent code base involving a costly maintenance process. [Goal] We report our experience on replacing a legacy BDS with a microservice-based event-driven system. [Method] We applied action research, investigating the reasons that motivate the adoption of a microservice-based event-driven architecture, intervening to define the new architecture, and documenting the challenges and lessons learned. [Results] We perceived that the resulting architecture enabled easier maintenance and fault-isolation. However, the myriad of technologies and the complex data flow were perceived as drawbacks.

TI Rate Limiting in an Event-Driven BGP Speaker
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
DT Article
DE BGP; Rate limiting; Event-driven architecture
AB Implementing BGP route processing in an event-driven manner appears to be advantageous in terms of scalability. However, the inter-domain routing system as a whole would be overwhelmed without some type of rate limiting on BGP update streams. At first glace, an event-driven, pipelined route processing model does not seem to fit well with the traditional timer-based way of implementing BGP rate-limiting. In this paper we present a lazy event-driven BGP route processing pipeline that easily accommodates rate limiting.

AB This paper presents a cross-layer self-healing approach for Cloud computing environments, based on the Complex Event Processing method. It analyzes monitored events to detect performance-related problems and performs action to fix them without human intervention. Our proposal makes use of novel analysis rules, derived from a comprehensive study of the relationships between monitored metrics across multiple Cloud layers. The results of our study are used to define and optimize the analysis rules and identify the causes of performance-related problems. The results of several experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of speeding up the analysis without affecting the quality of the diagnosis.

DE Composite event; Context-aware data; Streaming data; Event detection;

AB Composite event processing systems are useful in various application domains such as stock data stream monitoring, RFID data management, web access pattern monitoring, etc. The tree-based method is a typical method for implementing composite event processing system. In this paper, we introduce an optimization method called "condensed composition" for the tree-based composite event processing. "Condensed composition" divides the events in groups to participate the composition. We analyze the reason why the performance is improved and propose the idea of using the statistics of the "condensation degree" to dynamically decide using condensed composition or not for different data characteristics. In the experiments, the "condensed composition" method significantly improved the performance on the real stock data.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY

ID INTERNET; THINGS
AB The cloud computing has driven the fast development of the IoT services and applications. When a amount of real-time events in smart IoT applications are delivered to the cloud for processing, the loading on cloud computing becomes heavier, which can result in processing delays and exceeding their deadlines. The nodes in fog computing are closer to edge devices, which can process such these real-time events in this layer. With this fog process, the event processing efficiency can be enhanced and delays can also be solved in cloud computing.
   This paper designs a set of fog computing framework called distributed fog computing scheme (D-FOG) that can improve the better processing performance of real-time IoT applications than conventional cloud computing. Through the simulation experiments, the final results indicate that the D-FOG yields the better performance in terms of Expired event rate, Event success rate, Average delay time, and Average processing time. Consequently, the proposed D-FOG is more effective and efficient in real-time events processing than conventional cloud computing.

AB The CMS experiment started to utilize Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to accelerate the online reconstruction and event selection running on its High Level Trigger (HLT) farm in the 2022 data taking period. The projections of the HLT farm to the High-Luminosity LHC foresee a significant use of compute accelerators in the LHC Run 4 and onwards in order to keep the cost, size, and power budget of the farm under control. This direction of leveraging compute accelerators has synergies with the increasing use of HPC resources in HEP computing, as HPC machines are employing more and more compute accelerators that are predominantly GPUs today. In this work we review the features developed for the CMS data processing framework, CMSSW, to support the effective utilization of both compute accelerators and many-core CPUs within a highly concurrent task-based framework. We measure the impact of various design choices for the scheduling of heterogeneous algorithms on the event processing throughput, using the Run-3 HLT application as a realistic use case.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are an integral part of modern data centres to ensure high availability and compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently, NIDS are deployed on high-performance, high-cost middleboxes that are responsible for monitoring a limited section of the network. The fast increasing size and aggregate throughput of modern data centre networks have come to challenge the current approach to anomaly detection to satisfy the fast growing compute demand.
   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distributed intrusion detection systems based on the architecture of recently proposed event processing frameworks. We have designed and implemented a prototype system using Apache Storm to show the benefits of the proposed approach as well as the architectural differences with traditional systems. Our system distributes modules across the available devices within the network fabric and uses a centralised controller for orchestration, management and correlation. Following the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, the controller maintains a complete view of the network but distributes the processing logic for quick event processing while performing complex event correlation centrally. We have evaluated the proposed system using publicly available data centre traces and demonstrated that the system can scale with the network topology while providing high performance and minimal impact on packet latency.

AB For large-scale, and real-time processing, cloud systems are widely used due to their high scalability and availability. In this paper, we propose workload distribution methods for location-based event processing on the cloud systems. We define a measure of the workload, and focus on the balanced distribution of workload because in cloud systems the workload distribution is very important with respect to the system performance. For the balanced distribution of workload, we propose four methods: (1) round-robin data distribution, (2) round-robin query distribution, (3) data/query distribution via space partitioning and (4) skew-aware distribution. The round-robin data distribution method focuses on a balanced distribution of event data whereas queries are replicated in all cluster nodes. In the round-robin query distribution method, queries are evenly distributed whereas the event is replicated. The data/query distribution via space partitioning distributes event data and queries based on their spatial attribute values. Lastly, the skew-aware distribution method considers the non-uniformity of event data and queries. With extensive experiments, we evaluate the performances of our proposed methods

AB We summarize results of the initial in-orbit performance of the pulse shape processor (PSP) of the soft x-ray spectrometer instrument onboard ASTRO-H (Hitomi). Event formats, kind of telemetry, and the pulse-processing parameters are described, and the parameter settings in orbit are listed. The PSP was poweredon 2 days after launch, and the event threshold was lowered in orbit. The PSP worked fine in orbit, and there was neither memory error nor SpaceWire communication error until the break-up of spacecraft. Time assignment, electrical crosstalk, and the event screening criteria are studied. It is confirmed that the event processing rate at 100% central processing unit load is similar to 200 c/s/array, compliant with the requirement on the PSP. (c) The Authors.

ID PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM
AB Recent improvements in network and workstation performance have made workstation clusters an attractive architecture for diverse workloads, including interactive sequential and parallel applications. Although viable hardware solutions are available today, the largest challenge in making such a cluster usable lies in the system software. This paper describes the design and implementation of GLUnix, operating system middleware for a cluster of workstations. GLUnix was designed to provide transparent remote execution, support for interactive parallel and sequential jobs, load ballancing, and backward compatibility for existing application binaries, GLUnix was constructed to be easily portable to a number of platforms. GLUnix has been in daily use for over two and a half Sears and is currently running on a 100-node cluster of Sun UltraSPARCs. This paper relates our experiences with designing, building, and operating GLUnix. We discuss three important design tradeoffs faced by any cluster system, and present the reasons for our choices. Each of these design decisions is then re-evaluated in light of both our experience and recent technological advancements. We then describe the user-level, centralized, event-driven architecture of GLUnix and highlight a number of aspects of the implementation. Performance and scalability measurements of the system indicate that a centralized, user-level design can scale gracefully to significant cluster sizes, incurring only an additional 220 mu s of overhead per node for remote execution. The discussion focuses on the successes and failures me encountered while building and maintaining the system, including a characterization of the limitations of a user-level implementation and various features that were added to satisfy the user community.

TI THE HIGH COUNT RATE PERFORMANCE OF A 2-DIMENSIONALLY POSITION-SENSITIVE
   DETECTOR FOR POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
DT Article
AB In positron tomographs using a small number of position-sensitive detectors, each detector must operate at high singles event rates, especially during dynamic studies. To enable the PENN-PET tomograph to perform studies involving high data rates, the high count rate behaviour of the position-sensitive scintillation detector used in the tomograph was investigated at singles rates in excess of 2 million counts per second (MCPS). Detector dead-time, minimised through the use of pulse clipping  (clipping time, 120 ns), is a maximum of 20% at the highest data rates. At 2 MCPS and 240 ns pulse intergration time, the full width at half maximum of the point spread function (PSF) worsens by approximately 20% over it low count rate value of 5.2 mm. Furthermore, at high count rates, pulse pile-up produces long tails in the PSF along the detector''s long axis. These tails were reduced or eliminated through the use of a shortened pulse integration time (160 ns instead of 240 ns), an upper level  energy discriminator and a local centroid event positioning algorithm. Detector performance was characterised for different combinations of these event processing techniques, and the mechanisms by which pulse pile-up disorts the high count rate PSF were investigated using computer simulations. With the incorporation of the high count rate event processing techniques, the detector''s count rate capability enables the PENN-PET tomograph to handle most current imaging protocols.

AB Cloud computing has attracted increasing interest in industry and academia. However, due to the constantly expanding scale of cloud platforms, the monitoring of clouds encounters a number of critical challenges related to flexibility, scalability, efficiency, and performance. In this paper, we present JRang Cloud Monitoring System (JTangCMS), an efficient monitoring system for cloud platforms. Our contributions cover the collection, delivery, and processing of monitoring data. For data collection, a flexible and scalable agent is implemented with pluggable monitoring components to collect runtime information from different entities. For data delivery, an efficient and robust data dissemination framework is implemented to transmit the runtime information reliably with high throughput and low latency, based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS). For data processing, a cloud action platform is developed to support cloud management decision-making, based on complex event processing (CEP). Finally, detailed experimental evaluations show the feasibility and efficiency of JTangCMS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using imperative programming to process event streams, such as those generated by multi-touch devices and 3D cameras, has significant engineering drawbacks. Declarative approaches solve common problems but so far, they have not been able to scale on multicore systems while providing guaranteed response times.
   We propose PARTE, a parallel scalable complex event processing engine that allows for a declarative definition of event patterns and provides soft real-time guarantees for their recognition. The proposed approach extends the classical Rete algorithm and maps event matching onto a graph of actor nodes. Using a tiered event matching model, PARTE provides upper bounds on the detection latency by relying on a combination of non-blocking message passing between Rete nodes and safe memory management techniques. The performance evaluation shows the scalability of our approach on up to 64 cores. Moreover, it indicates that PARTE's design choices lead to more predictable performance compared to a PARTE variant without soft real-time guarantees. Finally, the evaluation indicates further that gesture recognition can benefit from the exposed parallelism with superlinear speedups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE workstealing; multicore; system services; performance; event-driven
AB Many high-performance communicating systems are designed using the event-driven paradigm. As multicore platforms are now pervasive, it becomes crucial for such systems to take advantage of the available hardware parallelism. Event-coloring is a promising approach in this regard. First, it allows programmers to simply and progressively inject support for the safe, parallel execution of multiple event handlers through the use of annotations. Second, it relies on a workstealing algorithm to dynamically balance the execution of event handlers on the available cores.
   This paper studies the impact of the workstealing algorithm on the overall system performance. We first show that the only existing workstealing algorithm designed for event-coloring runtimes is not always efficient: for instance, it causes a 33% performance degradation on a Web server. We then introduce several enhancements to improve the workstealing behavior. An evaluation using both microbenchmarks and real applications, a Web server and the Secure File Server (SFS), shows that our system consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art runtime (Libasync-smp), with or without workstealing. In particular, our new workstealing improves performance by up to +25% compared to Libasync-smp without workstealing and by up to +73% compared to the Libasync-smp workstealing algorithm, in the Web server case.

AB Many high-performance networked applications are designed using the event-driven paradigm. In many-core era, hundreds or even thousands of processor cores can be utilized to serve more clients. However, data race and load imbalance in current event-driven hybrid models will be a key bottleneck which challenges developers to fully exploit many-core resources to develop high-performance networked applications.
   In this paper, we extend the symmetric multi-thread event-driven model and present Paraio, a scalable network I/O framework to improve performance of networked applications such as web servers and software-defined network (SDN) controllers. In order to maximize the degree of parallelism in the event-based application execution, Paraio features the shared-data marking method that divides the event-processing logic and marks event handlers from the essential shared data perspective. In Paraio runtime, workloads are balanced among threads by an efficient work stealing, and new connection is allocated according to threads' load to obtain a fast response. Evaluation on web server and SDN controller, shows that Paraio applications with work stealing achieve better performance and scalability.

AB Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has brought tremendous benefits for business processing, especially in incorporating RFID data into Supply Chain Management (SCM. With the explosion of RFID data, there has raised important problem how to mine valuable information from tremendous and potentially infinite volumes of RFID data. Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology used to process RFID data has attracted increasing attention. However, the current researches usually focus on centralized CEP architecture, which requires greater bandwidth and computational capability, and Lacks of robustness and scalability because of single point failure or network break. This paper first proposes a novel distributed CEP architecture, which spreads centralized CEP tasks load over multiple communicating stations by a space-based communication paradigm over a distributed message broker architecture based on Jini network. A distributed complex event detection algorithm based on Master-workers pattern is proposed The results of experiment show that the performance of our approach is remarkable in the large-scale RFID applications.

AB Social self-threat during physical stress, such as exposure to the cold pressor test and isometric handgrip test, has been shown to induce activation of the HPA axis, in addition to autonomic responses. However, previous research has suggested that dysfunctional post-event processing may play a major role in neuroendocrine reactivity at initial as well as subsequent social stress exposure. In the present study, we investigated how the interplay of context (i.e. performance feedback) with state (i.e., self-esteem) as well as trait-like factors (i.e., ruminative tendencies) affects stress responses to repeated, short bouts of physical activity. On two sessions, 1 week apart, 53 participants (27 women) performed an isometric handgrip task for 3 min, during which they were exposed to social-evaluative threat. In addition, participants received fake feedback on their performance immediately after the task, labeling it as either `above' (positive) or 'below average' (negative). In addition to neuroendocrine (cortisol), cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure) and subjective stress reactivity, performance-related and social dimensions of state self-esteem were assessed before and after stress induction. Substantial increases in cardiovascular parameters were found on both days, regardless of feedback condition. However, positive feedback led to significantly diminished neuroendocrine responses on day 1, whereas baseline cortisol on session 2 was significantly higher in the negative feedback group. Conversely, social self-esteem decreased after stress induction on both days only for participants who had received negative feedback. Changes in self-esteem reported on day 1 were associated with increased baseline cortisol at the second session, while interindividual differences in self-reported (trait) rumination were associated with cortisol reactivity at session 1. Taken together, the results suggest that effects of social evaluation during short periods of physical stress rely on post-event processing and might be counteracted by positive appraisal directly after stress exposure. Post-hoc framing (in terms of success vs. failure) may predict subsequent stress-related hormonal effects better than task demands per se, which should be considered as a potential moderator in future acute stress research, but might also be relevant to many practical applications in fields ranging from sports/performance to health psychology.

AB Complex event detection technology aims at extracting valuable information from continuously incoming massive stream data quickly and accurately, which is one of the key components of complex event processing platform. XML is usually regarded as one of the data models of complex event processing platform. Although there are many efficient filtering algorithms for XML stream data, they are generally unable to support complex event queries that contain timing relationships. So we used the regular tree pattern to describe the complex event pattern, generated the macro forest transducers and the automatic for regular part matching based on the regular tree pattern grammar and proposed an efficient complex event detection method. The experimental results prove that the method have strong capability on complex event detection.

DE Complex Event Processing; Graphics Processing Units; CUDA; Parallelism
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a well-known technology in real-time Big Data processing systems. Performance of CEP engines is expected to scale with ever-increasing data rates and complex use cases. CEP operators like stream join and event patterns involve high computational complexity; hence, have a considerable impact on the overall query processing performance. Distributed event processing and CPU-level parallel event processing algorithms are common approaches for improving the performance. We explore how commodity massively parallel architectures like modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can be utilized to improve the performance of frequently used CEP operators. We demonstrate how CEP operators such as event filter, event window, and stream join can be redesigned and implemented on GPUs to gain an order of magnitude improvement in throughput compared to a CPU-based implementation. This work is demonstrated using NVIDIA CUDA based implementation of CEP operators for Siddhi CEP engine on low-end GPUs. Moreover, this approach reduces event queuing at the incoming event queue, even with a large number of event streams, high arrival rates, and several complex queries. Consequently, the average latency experienced by incoming events is also reduced.

DE Mobile Complex Event Processing; Remote Patient Monitoring System;
   Internet of Things; Smart Healthcare
AB This paper introduces an edge-computing based Complex Event Processing (CEP) architecture for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) which is an important issue in the context of remote healthcare. In this architecture, the detection of complex events, that may indicate impending health problems, is performed on a mobile device that receives data from sensors attached to the body of a patient. The detected complex events are sent to a back-end hospital server running on a cloud for further processing. Current state-of-the-art RPM techniques use the mobile device as an IoT gateway agent to forward data streams from health sensors to a remote hospital server where complex events are detected. A drawback of this existing methodology is that the mobile phone always needs to remain connected to the hospital server. Also, the mobile network consumption is increased while transferring large volumes of sensor data streams thus leading to an increase in the user cost. Additionally, it leads to an increase in the workload at the hospital server that serves multiple patients. This research investigates a mobile device based CEP system for addressing these issues and demonstrates its viability through a proof-of-concept prototype. A thorough performance analysis is performed using a synthetic workload that provides insights into system scalability and the relationship between system/workload parameters and performance.

   Congestion; Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET)
AB Magnitude of urban population and unplanned development of cities have led to road traffic congestion in major cities and added increasing pressure on overall road transport and road related infrastructure. Nowadays, intelligent transportation systems such as Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) are used for distributed road traffic. VANET is a wireless network that gathers complex and randomly generated data related to distributed traffic along with other information such as weather con ditions on real time basis. In this paper, the Author has attempted to implement a system on Event Driven Architecture (EDA) to detect complex but similar levels of traffic congestion which resembles real life traffic situation. The system is designed with the help of a technique called Complex Event Processing (CEP) that treats all messages in the network from corresponding vehicles as an event. The effectiveness of this system can be observed by using different performance metrics.

AB Cloud computing is a powerful technique to increase hardware utilization dramatically and to scale up computational infrastructure instantly. To improve resource utilization, the cloud resource management system could suspend/migrate some running jobs/virtual machines in order to reserve resources for other ones. While the cost of moving the whole virtual machines is too high due to the big size of virtual machines, application level migration is a possible solution. We are interested in using checkpointing and recovery technique (C&R) to stop and restart running programs on virtual machines. The paper introduces the event-based checkpointing tool (EBC), in which users can easily checkpoint and restart running programs in cloud systems. EBC is based on event-driven architecture and supports both sequential and parallel programs like MPI programs. EBC is a useful tool supporting migration as well as scheduling in cloud systems.

AB Event processing is the cornerstone of the dynamic and responsive Internet of Things (IoT). Recent approaches in this area are based on representational state transfer (REST) principles, which allow event processing tasks to be placed at any device that follows the same principles. However, the tasks should be properly distributed among edge devices to ensure fair resources utilization and guarantee seamless execution. This article investigates the use of deep learning to fairly distribute the tasks. An attention-based neural network model is proposed to generate efficient load balancing solutions under different scenarios. The proposed model is based on the Transformer and Pointer Network architectures, and is trained by an advantage actorcritic reinforcement learning algorithm. The model is designed to scale to the number of event processing tasks and the number of edge devices, with no need for hyperparameters re-tuning or even retraining. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional heuristics in many key performance indicators. The generic design and the obtained results show that the proposed model can potentially be applied to several other load balancing problem variations, which makes the proposal an attractive option to be used in real-world scenarios due to its scalability and efficiency.

TI Balancing parallelization and asynchronization in event-driven programs

SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE

DE concurrency; event-driven; OpenMP; performance model; virtual target
AB OpenMP is a popular multiprocessing interface to parallelize different domains of applications. A previously proposed extension has made it possible for OpenMP to speedup event-driven programs. There, a virtual target model extension is used to incrementally introduce asynchronous execution into an OpenMP program. At the same time it allows a mixture of nested parallelism with asynchronous processing. This new possibility raises the question how to use available processors/threads, for parallelism or for asynchronous execution? To investigate the best combination of asynchronization and parallelization, a performance model for measuring parallel event-driven systems is proposed. Based on queue theory, the theoretical analysis discovers some interesting facts in an event-driven system. Then, experiments are conducted to study the best practice of improving event-driven programs and how to balance parallelism and asynchronous execution. By comparing it with the OpenMP tasking model, the evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the virtual target model, which is able to achieve significantly better parallel event-driven performance.

AB Overload control requires different scheduling policies in different application scenarios. In this work, we propose an API that allows the programmer to choose and program scheduling policies in the specific setting of a staged event-driven architecture. Through the study of various scheduling policies, we have extracted common requirements and built an interface that allows developers to build and combine scheduling controllers. The implementation is specific to the Leda event-driven architecture, but the same model could be applied in other systems with similar needs. Using this interface, we have built controllers for a set of scheduling policies, and we report the results of experiments with these policies in two Leda applications with different load profiles.

AB Being able to analyze information collected from streams of data, generated by different types of sensors, is becoming increasingly important in many domains. This paper presents an approach for creating a decoupled semantically enabled event processing system, which leverages existing Semantic Web technologies. By implementing the actor model, we show how we can create flexible and robust event processing systems, which can leverage different technologies in the same general workflow. We argue that in this context RSP systems can be viewed as generic systems for creating semantically enabled event processing agents. In the demonstration scenario we show how real-time monitoring can be used to support criminal intelligence analysis, and describe how the actor model can be leveraged further to support scalability.

AB Most embedded control systems react on events in the real world by reading sensors and controlling actuators in real-time. This general behavior can be directly mapped onto event-driven systems in a natural and straightforward manner for a large variety of applications. Further real-time analysis and profiling on the same level of abstraction is possible for event-driven systems. This significantly helps developers of deeply embedded real-time applications. In this paper we introduce simulative profiling concepts and static analysis basics for the real-time analysis of event-driven systems. Furthermore we present a prototype analysis tool for the REFLEX operating system that integrates real-time analysis into the software development cycle.

AB As the Web is becoming a communication and collaboration platform, there is an acute need for an infrastructure to disseminate real-time events over the Web. However, such infrastructure is still seriously lacking as conventional distributed event-based systems are not designed for the Web. To address this issue, we develop a RESTful web service framework, R-Event. It represents and encapsulates the structural elements of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) into the infrastructure of REST (Representational State Transfer), the architectural style that underlies the Web. Our approach leads to an event-driven web consisting of 4 layers of RESTful web services. The R-Event framework implements the layers that are pivotal to the event-driven web. The core component of this framework is federated topic hubs that provide services for notification publication, subscription, delivery, tracking, and linking. The advantages and applications of this approach are presented and discussed, including the important features of addressability, connectedness, dynamic topology, robustness, scalability, and efficient notifications. A prototype system for presence driven collaboration is developed and the preliminary performance tests show that the proposed approach is feasible and advantageous.

DE Stream Data Mining; CEP; event pattern; performance optimization
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a branch of stream data mining, which is usually used to discover event patterns. Generally, a complex event processing engine uses nonprocedural declaration language and state machine to define event patterns. It generates synopses of universe data by sliding window model, therefore could identify event patterns which users care about from rapidly changing and potentially infinite event stream in a relatively short time. Among all the data streams, monitoring data flow is easy to describe by events, so CEP is suitable for supervision or decision control for business system. However, CEP does not support backtracking to eliminate invalid data, which limits CEP in supervision or decision control applications. The traditional complex event processing try to solve this problem by defining more complicated event patterns to avoid invalid results, the side effect of which would be heavier workload onto the engine. For this problem, we propose an optimized complex-event-processing model OCM. OCM will decompose complicated event patterns into small ones according to their relations, and distribute these patterns to more than one CEP engines to hierarchically filter invalid data. It can eliminate invalid data with better performance than the traditional approaches. We have also implemented the prototype and designed experiments to test the effectiveness of OCM. We have applied this model into Aviation Application in EU FP6 project Bridge.

AB In order to improve convenience, efficiency, and safety in vehicular networking applications (VNA), we propose a novel business model based on platform production services (PPS), design an inter-cloud architecture, and then apply this emerging scheme to vehicle maintenance services (VMS). Both internet of things (IoT) sensing framework and inter-cloud computing architecture are the crucial factors in implementing PPS business model. In the proposed scheme, implementation concept, system architecture, and scalable applications are introduced. Then we design IoT sensing framework for VNA, including cloud services and computation level scalability, inter-cloud architecture supporting telematics applications, and telematics application scenarios. After dissecting mobile cloud computing forming mechanism, we carry out the semantic modeling analysis for inter-cloud service model, and then design a VMS event processing flow to allow the management and cooperation among diverse components by means of event manager. The performance evaluation exemplified by VMS is implemented by means of probabilistic methods. The results show that convenience and efficiency increase in VNA as compared to existing schemes.

AB Effective and efficient classification to transient disturbance is crucial to provide reasonable decision making for solving power quality problems. Existing approaches for detecting transient disturbance classification are often centralized and procedure-oriented, which are developed in a hard code manner, and therefore possibly will face scalability and extensibility problems. In this paper, a novel approach to detecting transient disturbance classification is proposed by utilizing Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology in order to excavate features of transient disturbance effectively and efficiently from real-time, dynamic, and massive data. Each of occurrences of transient disturbance is modeled as an atomic event. A category of transient disturbance is expressed as a complex event that consists of multiple atomic events with logical operations represented by event pattern languages (EPL). The task of detecting classification of transient disturbance can be reduced to filtering and matching events from a real time event stream of transient disturbance in terms of given event patterns. The related experiments show that the CEP technology has significant advantages in the system throughput and latency event processing, and thus has strong scalability and extensibility. Our approach can provide a feasible solution for detecting classification of transient disturbance for massive real-time data with multiple sources.

AB Traditional business data processing hardcodes a series of business rules as an executable business process, which facilitates the automation of business processes. However, such data processing approaches failed to tackle the problem of dynamic changes of business rules when new business requirements need to be considered and old business rules are modified. They have suffered from the severe problems of extensibility and scalability for real-time data processing. In this paper, a novel approach to process transformation driven Complex Event Processing (CEP) is proposed, in which business processes are transformed to editable rule data rather than hardcoded programs, and thus is extensible and scalable for efficient real-time data processing. We theoretically prove that our CEP based procedure transformation preserves the original semantics of business rules. A case from detecting classification of transient disturbance for massive real-time data is studied to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. The related experiments show that the CEP technology has significant advantages in the system throughput and latency event processing, and thus has strong scalability and extensibility.

AB Current process control systems are composed of a large number of components and subsystems operating at different layers of the control system architecture model (i.e. measurement and control devices, Distributed Control Systems, Advanced Process Control systems, and Manufacturing Execution Systems). The IMC-AESOP project aims at designing the next generation architecture of process automation systems. In order to ensure system scalability and modularity, the new architectural design follows the SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) design principles. Moreover, the design assumes adoption of various technologies with the aim to enable the control systems to meet all functional and performance requirements. The CEP (Complex Event Processing) technology has been selected for being able to provide efficient asynchronous communication (within and across architecture layers) and the capability of temporal reasoning over large amounts of system-generated events. This paper describes the intermediate results of the IMC-AESOP project, outlining the architectural concepts related to the use of the SOA and CEP technologies in the context of advanced alarm management applications - alarm load shedding and state-based alarming.

AB Background: Paediatric social anxiety disorder (SoAD) responds poorly to treatment. Improved understanding of potential psychological maintaining processes may indicate fruitful directions to improve treatment outcomes. The current study compared self-reported psychological processes and state anxiety in response to two social tasks experienced by children and adolescents with SoAD against comparison samples. Methods: 641 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years (Mage = 9.45 yr; 47.6% girls) engaged in a brief, impromptu speech and a social discussion with a confederate. Participants included 307 with SoAD, 285 with other mental disorders, and 49 non-clinical controls. Participants who completed each task self-reported their anticipated probability and cost of negative evaluation, self-focused attention, personal evaluation of social performance, and engagement in post-event rumination (assessed 1 h later). Independent raters also scored their social performance. Relationships between the variables were tested through path analysis. Results: Participants with SoAD were more likely to avoid and reported significantly greater state anxiety than both comparison groups. They also reported higher levels of each of the putative maintaining processes than either comparison group. In contrast, independent observers did not discriminate between groups on their overt social performance. Path analyses demonstrated good fit of a priori models to the data for both social tasks. Conclusions: Paediatric SoAD is associated with strong expectation of the probability and cost of negative evaluation, excess self-focused attention, and more negative evaluation of one's own social performance. In turn, these putative processes are strong predictors of state anxiety and post-event processing in response to both a speech and social interaction.

AB Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) produces enormous events. The key issue in IoT application is how to process the events. In this paper a proactive complex event processing method using parallel Markov Decision Processes is proposed for large-scale IoT. Based on a multi-layered adaptive dynamic Bayesian model, an accurate predictive analytics method is proposed. A parallel Markov decision processes model is designed to support proactive event processing. A state partition method and a reward decomposition method are used to support large-scale application. The experimental evaluations show that this method has good accuracy and scalability when used to process complex event proactively in large-scale internet of things.

AB Event correlation is a service provided by middleware platforms that allows components in a publish/subscribe architecture to subscribe to patterns of events rather than individual events. Event correlation improves the scalability and performance of distributed systems, increases their analyzability, while reducing their complexity by moving functionality to the middleware. To ensure that event correlation is provided as a standard and reliable service, it must possess well-defined and unambiguous semantics.
   In this paper we present a language and formal model for event correlation with operational semantics defined in terms of transducers. The language has been motivated by an avionics application and includes constructs for modes in addition to the more common constructs such as selection, accumulation and sequential composition. Prototype event processing engines for this language have been implemented in both C++ and Java and are now being integrated with third-party event channels.

AB At present, it has been developed in automation technology for many years. Especially, the Internet of Things technology is quite mature. However, in the Internet of Things technology, there is a lack of rapid processing of distributed task service architecture. In most IoT models, active ones are mainly implemented through human operations, take the service to a hardware device system. Especially when it is necessary to expand to many device operations, it is necessary to use the Internet of Things for service applications, it will face the problem of not being able to operate at the same time. This research proposes an innovative IoT platform architecture, which improves the problem of only single behavioral event processing for existing connected devices and provides more different context application services.

AB This paper describes the methodology and implementation of an event management system, called Event Insight, for highly distributed systems, which was built by SAP to solve the scalability and reliability problems faced by SAP customers in industries such as logistics, supply-chain, oil and gas, and consumer product goods. The core of the approach integrates three main technologies together: event federation, an event processing network, and complex event processing. This paper will use a high-level motivating example from the oil and gas industry to illustrate the use of the technology.

AB Systems of systems (SoS) are large-scale systems composed of complex systems with difficult to predict emergent properties. One of the most significant challenges in the engineering of such systems is how to predict their Non-functional Properties (NFP) such as performance and security, and more specifically, how to model NFP when the overall system functionality is not available. In this paper, we identify, describe and analyse challenges to modelling and analysing the performance and security NFP of SoS. We define an architectural framework to SoS NFP prediction based on the modelling of system interactions and their impacts. We adopt an Event Driven Architecture to support this modelling, as it allows for more realistic and flexible NFP simulation, which enables more accurate NFP prediction. A framework integrating the analysis of several NFP allows for exploring the impacts of changes made to accommodate issues on one NFP on other NFPs.

AB Over the years, more cloud computing systems have been developed providing flexible interfaces for inter-cloud interaction. This work approaches the concept of inter-cloud by utilizing APIs, open source specifications and exposed interfaces from cloud platforms such as OpenStack, OpenNebula and others. Despite other works in the area of inter-cloud, that are mainly resource management-centric, we focus on designing and developing a service-centric architecture. We implement an inter-cloud bridge system that is elastic, easy to be upgraded and managed. We develop a prototype composed not only from heterogeneous cloud platforms but also from independent cloud services. These are developed by different cloud service providers and offered as open source Software as a Service (SaaS). The proposed Inter-Cloud Mediation Service uses Future Internet SaaS such as a Context Broker for registrations and subscriptions to services and a Complex Event Processing engine for event management. We present an experimental analysis to show interactions with various heterogeneous cloud platforms and we evaluate the performance of inter-cloud services separately and as a whole.

AB We present a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline to classify triggers versus background events in this paper. This pipeline makes online decisions to select signal data and enables the intelligent trigger system for efficient data collection in the Data Acquisition System (DAQ) of the upcoming sPHENIX and future EIC (Electron-Ion Collider) experiments. Starting from the coordinates of pixel hits that are lightened by passing particles in the detector, the pipeline applies three-stage of event processing (hits clustering, track reconstruction, and trigger detection) and labels all processed events with the binary tag of trigger versus background events. The pipeline consists of deterministic algorithms such as clustering pixels to reduce event size, tracking reconstruction to predict candidate edges, and advanced graph neural network-based models for recognizing the entire jet pattern. In particular, we apply the message-passing graph neural network to predict links between hits and reconstruct tracks and a hierarchical pooling algorithm (DiffPool) to make the graph-level trigger detection. We obtain an impressive performance (>= 70% accuracy) for trigger detection with only 3200 neuron weights in the end-to-end pipeline. We deploy the end-to-end pipeline into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and accelerate the three stages with speedup factors of 1152, 280, and 21, respectively.

DE Android static analysis; event-driven systems; control-flow abstraction
AB We present jumping, a form of selective control-flow abstraction useful for improving the scalability of goal-directed static analyses. Jumping is useful for analyzing programs with complex control-flow such as event-driven systems. In such systems, accounting for orderings between certain events is important for precision, yet analyzing the product graph of all possible event orderings is intractable. Jumping solves this problem by allowing the analysis to selectively abstract away control-flow between events irrelevant to a goal query while preserving information about the ordering of relevant events. We present a framework for designing sound jumping analyses and create an instantiation of the framework for performing precise inter-event analysis of Android applications. Our experimental evaluation showed that using jumping to augment a precise goal-directed analysis with inter-event reasoning enabled our analysis to prove 90-97% of dereferences safe across our benchmarks.

DE fog computing; internet of things; performance benchmarking
AB Fog data processing systems provide key abstractions to manage data and event processing in the geo-distributed and heterogeneous fog environment. The lack of standardized benchmarks for such systems, however, hinders their development and deployment, as different approaches cannot be compared quantitatively. Existing cloud data benchmarks are inadequate for fog computing, as their focus on workload specification ignores the tight integration of application and infrastructure inherent in fog computing.
   In this paper, we outline an approach to a fog-native data processing benchmark that combines workload specifications with infrastructure specifications. This holistic approach allows researchers and engineers to quantify how a software approach performs for a given workload on given infrastructure. Further, by basing our benchmark in a realistic IoT sensor network scenario, we can combine paradigms such as low-latency event processing, machine learning inference, and offline data analytics, and analyze the performance impact of their interplay in a fog data processing system.

AB Monitoring health status requires collecting a large amount of data from the human body. The sensor can be used to collect data from the human body. The sensor transmits data for almost every second across the internet. The challenge of the health monitoring system is the massive amount of incoming data. Therefore, a system capable of sending, storing, analyzing, and visualizing vast amounts of data is required for health monitoring. A previous study proposed microservice and event-driven architecture. It also proposed a single database for all services and a relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing time series data, which might reduce the data transmission performance and reliability. This research intends to improve the monitoring system from the previous study to accommodate a greater throughput, faster database read and write operations, and a more reliable system design. The improvement consists of multiple changes in system architecture and technology. A multi-database is proposed in the system architecture to improve system reliability. Time series database and Message Queue Telemetry Protocol (MQTT) server are proposed as an upgrade on technology. As a result, the proposed system throughput is 2.43 times faster than the old system. On database performance, the new system's database write speed is 20.95 times faster and the database read speed is 1.64 times faster than the old system. The proposed system also achieves better scalability, resilience, and independence.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Information and communication technologies backbone of a smart city is an Internet of Things (IoT) application that combines technologies such as low power IoT networks, device management, analytics or event stream processing. Hence, designing an efficient IoT architecture for real-time IoT applications brings technical challenges that include the integration of application network protocols and data processing. In this context, the system scalability of two architectures has been analysed: the first architecture, named as POST architecture, integrates the hyper text transfer protocol with an Extract-Transform-Load technique, and is used as baseline; the second architecture, named as MQTT-CEP, is based on a publish-subscribe protocol, i.e. message queue telemetry transport, and a complex event processor engine. In this analysis, SAVIA, a smart city citizen security application, has been deployed following both architectural approaches. Results show that the design of the network protocol and the data analytic layer impacts highly in the Quality of Service experimented by the final IoT users. The experiments show that the integrated MQTT-CEP architecture scales properly, keeps energy consumption limited and thereby, promotes the development of a distributed IoT architecture based on constraint resources. The drawback is an increase in latency, mainly caused by the loosely coupled communication pattern of MQTT, but within reasonable levels which stabilize with increasing workloads.

AB Recently, the design of spiking neural networks (SNNs) processors based on FPGA have become a hot research topic for their low power and high efficiency. However, most existing works lack flexibility in configuration to accomplish efficient computation of deep SNNs with different network structures (e.g., residuals). In this brief, a high-performance general spiking convolution processing unit and the corresponding hardware architecture (named SCPU) is designed to support both standard and residual convolution; then, a neuromorphic processor containing SCPU (called FPGA-SCPP) is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Specifically, the model parameters are fused and quantified to reduce the computational amounts and simplify its hardware implementation. And a spike event processing unit is designed based on event computation and direct data flow to complete the standard and residual convolution computations. The experimental results show the FPGA-SCPP can effectively deploy different large-scale SNNs models such as VGG and ResNet, with the highest recognition accuracies of 92.45% and 68.55% on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, respectively. Our FPGA-SCPP has a computational power of only 1.7W and a frame rate of 40fps, which improves inference speed by about 6 times and reduces power consumption by 3 times compared to existing processors. Therefore, FPGA-SCPP can effectively accomplish the acceleration of deep SNNs, especially for models with spiking residual blocks.

AB The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) experiment at the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is preparing for the LHC Run3, beginning in 2021, with a detector and computing upgrade. On the computing side, a large, purpose-build computing farm (O2) consisting of CPU and GPU will process the data coming from the experimental setup at an average input rate of some 2TB/sec and output rate of 100GB/sec. The farm will consist of few hundred off-the-shelve servers, called Event Processing Nodes (EPN), collectively connected to a remote disk-based storage system. The EPNs will process data in near-real time during the ALICE detector operation with expected output rate to storage of similar to 100GB/sec. To avoid interruptions of processing due to network glitches or overload, we foresee to equip the EPNs with fast high-capacity SSDs for temporary data storage. The data stored on the SSDs must be transferred asynchronously to the remote storage element. The transfer operation is time-critical, as the SSDs will be able to hold at most a few hours of data accumulation. This paper presents a method for fast copying the files generated by the EPNs while ensuring no data loss and caching all the encountered errors.

AB This paper focuses on Probabilistic Complex Event Processing (PCEP) in the context of real world event sources of data streams. PCEP executes complex event pattern queries on the continuously streaming probabilistic data with uncertainty. The methodology consists of two phases: Efficient Generic Event Filtering (EGEF) and probabilistic event sequence prediction paradigm. In the first phase, a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) based event matching allows to filter the relevant events by discovering the occurrences of the user defined event patterns in a large volume of continuously arriving data streams. In order to, express the complex event patterns in a more efficient form, a Complex Event Processing (CEP) language named as Complex Event Pattern Subscription Language (CEPSL) is developed by extending the existing high level event query languages. Furthermore, query plan-based approach is used to compile the specified event patterns into the NFA automaton and to distribute to a cluster of state machines to improve the scalability. In the second phase, an effective Dynamic Fuzzy Probabilistic Relational Model (DFPRM) is proposed to construct the probability space in the form of event hierarchy. The proposed system deploys a Probabilistic Fuzzy Logic (PFL) based inference engine to derive the composite of event sequence approximately with the reduced probability space. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a detailed performance analysis is performed using a prototype implementation.

AB Smart cities are urban environments where Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide a continuous source of data about urban phenomena such as traffic and air pollution. The exploitation of the spatial properties of data enables situation and context awareness. However, the integration and analysis of data from IoT sensing devices remain a crucial challenge for the development of IoT applications in smart cities. Existing approaches provide no or limited ability to perform spatial data analysis, even when spatial information plays a significant role in decision making across many disciplines. This work proposes a generic approach to enabling spatiotemporal capabilities in information services for smart cities. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach to achieving data integration and real-time processing, and developed a reference architecture for the development of event-driven applications. This type of applications seamlessly integrates IoT sensing devices, complex event processing, and spatiotemporal analytics through a processing workflow for the detection of geographic events. Through the implementation and testing of a system prototype, built upon an existing sensor network, we demonstrated the feasibility, performance, and scalability of event-driven applications to achieve real-time processing capabilities and detect geographic events.

DE Complex Event Processing; Multi-Query Optimization
ID QUERY OPTIMIZATION
AB Rapid advances in data-driven applications over recent years have intensified the need for efficient mechanisms capable of monitoring and detecting arbitrarily complex patterns in massive data streams. This task is usually performed by complex event processing (CEP) systems. CEP engines are required to process hundreds or even thousands of user-defined patterns in parallel under tight real-time constraints. To enhance the performance of this crucial operation, multiple techniques have been developed, utilizing well-known optimization approaches such as pattern rewriting and sharing common subexpressions. However, the scalability of these methods is limited by the high computation overhead, and the quality of the produced plans is compromised by ignoring significant parts of the solution space.
   In this paper, we present a novel framework for real-time multi-pattern complex event processing. Our approach is based on formulating the above task as a global optimization problem and applying a combination of sharing and pattern reordering techniques to construct an optimal plan satisfying the problem constraints. To the best of our knowledge, no such fusion was previously attempted in the field of CEP optimization. To locate the best possible evaluation plan in the resulting hyperexponential solution space, we design efficient local search algorithms that utilize the unique problem structure. An extensive theoretical and empirical analysis of our system demonstrates its superiority over state-of-the-art solutions.

AB For the mass events monitored from IT infrastructures, it is critical that how to use them effectively to get more valuable information is critical, especially for the large-scale enterprises, application performance issues have an immediate impact on customers' experience and satisfaction. The challenge is that the systems are under uncertain and dynamic operating conditions, so it is difficult to identify the complex critical situations from the large numbers of various events. The existing complex event processing (CEP) systems cannot solve the problem efficiently, in this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to solve the complex event correlation. Combining the CEP with Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory method, we can find the anomalies timely and locate the root cause automatically. It offers leverage by considering the real-time and accuracy in detecting events.

AB This paper proposes a novel event-driven architecture for enhancing edge-based vehicular systems within smart transportation. Leveraging the inherent real-time, scalable, and fault-tolerant nature of the Elixir language, we present an innovative architecture tailored for edge computing. This architecture employs MQTT for efficient event transport and utilizes Elixir's lightweight concurrency model for distributed processing. Robustness and scalability are further ensured through the EMQX broker. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two smart transportation case studies: a traffic light system for dynamically adjusting signal timing, and a cab dispatch prototype designed for high concurrency and real-time data processing. Evaluations on an Apple M1 chip reveal consistently low latency responses below 5 ms and efficient multicore utilization under load. These findings showcase the system's robust throughput and multicore programming capabilities, confirming its suitability for real-time, distributed edge computing applications in smart transportation. Therefore, our work suggests that integrating Elixir with an event-driven model represents a promising approach for developing scalable, responsive applications in edge computing. This opens avenues for further exploration and adoption of Elixir in addressing the evolving demands of edge-based smart transportation systems.

TI Flame-MR: An event-driven architecture for MapReduce applications

AB Nowadays, many organizations analyze their data with the MapReduce paradigm, most of them using the popular Apache Hadoop framework. As the data size managed by MapReduce applications is steadily increasing, the need for improving the Hadoop performance also grows. Existing modifications of Hadoop (e.g., Mellanox Unstructured Data Accelerator) attempt to improve performance by changing some of its underlying subsystems. However, they are not always capable to cope with all its performance bottlenecks or they hinder its portability. Furthermore, new frameworks like Apache Spark or DataMPI can achieve good performance improvements, but they do not keep compatibility with existing MapReduce applications. This paper proposes Flame-MR, a new event-driven MapReduce architecture that increases Hadoop performance by avoiding memory copies and pipelining data movements, without modifying the source code of the applications. The performance evaluation on two representative systems (an HPC cluster and a public cloud platform) has shown experimental evidence of significant performance increases, reducing the execution time by up to 54% on the Amazon EC2 cloud.

AB Establishing upon the connectivity layer provided by Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, modern industries are moving towards management and computation solutions which enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) services for data intensive applications. This raises two important challenges: first, the information carried by data should be refined and prepared for the various AI algorithms via data processing pipelines and; second, a distributed orchestration solution for data and AI computation resources featuring with migration capabilities is required to support the refining process. In order to address these challenges, this paper introduces ERAIA, an actor-based framework which provides a novel basis to build intelligence and data pipelines. ERAIA facilitates the deployment and migration of distributed AI computations for heterogeneous and dynamic IoT scenarios. An implementation description is accompanied by relevant performance evaluations to demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the solution. ERAIA provides an interface to expand the scope of existing IoT systems as Application Enablement Platform (AEP), which hence accelerates the development of AI-based IoT solutions.

AB In recent years, there has been an increased need for the use of rule-based systems, systems required to act automatically based on events, or changes in the environment. Some events may be generated externally while others must be inferred by the system based on the other events. This event inference is inherently uncertain which is due to uncertain information sources and uncertain event occurrence. To design a solution provides us with the challenges of scalability of incoming events and inaccuracy of associated probabilities. Thus we provide a generic framework enabling such uncertain event inference in rule-based systems based on Probabilistic event model for events information, Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for approximation of probability of the events which uses selectability mechanism for improving the efficiency and performance of the overall system. The overall system works based on the prediction-correction paradigm. We also propose to use the Prioritization algorithm to prioritize client requests based on their needs and provide them with the best service.

AB Supporting real-time, cost-effective execution of Complex Event processing applications in the cloud has been an important goal for many scientists in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies as a powerful approach for large-scale Complex Event processing (CEP). However, determining the appropriate degree of parallelism of the DSPS' components can be particularly challenging as the volume of data streams is becoming increasingly large, the rule set is becoming continuously complex, and the system must be able to handle such large data stream volumes in real-time, taking into consideration changes in the burstiness levels and data characteristics. In this paper we describe our solution to building elastic complex event processing systems on top of our distributed CEP system which combines two commonly used frameworks, Storm and Esper, in order to provide both ease of usage and scalability. Our approach makes the following contributions: (i) we provide a mechanism for predicting the load and latency of the Esper engines in upcoming time windows, and (ii) we propose a novel algorithm for automatically adjusting the number of engines to use in the upcoming windows, taking into account the cost and the performance gains of possible changes. Our detailed experimental evaluation with a real traffic monitoring application that analyzes bus traces from the city of Dublin indicates the benefits in the working of our approach. Our proposal outperforms the current state of the art technique in regards to the amount of tuples that it can process by four orders of magnitude.

DE Legacy application; Serverless Computing; Migration; Empirical Study
AB Serverless is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that facilitates developers to focus solely on the application logic rather than provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure. The inherent characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency of serverless computing, attracted many companies to migrate their legacy applications toward this paradigm. However, the stateless nature of serverless requires careful migration planning, consideration of its subsequent implications, and potential challenges. To this end, this study investigates the intentions, strategies, and technical and organizational challenges while migrating to a serverless architecture. We investigated the migration processes of 11 systems across diverse domains by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with professionals from 11 organizations. We also presented a detailed discussion of each migration case. Our findings reveal that large enterprises primarily migrate to enhance scalability and operational efficiency, while smaller organizations intend to reduce the cost. Furthermore, organizations use a domain-driven design approach to identify the use case and gradually migrate to serverless using a strangler pattern. However, migration encounters technical challenges i.e., testing event-driven architecture, integrating with the legacy system, lack of standardization, and organizational challenges i.e., mindset change and hiring skilled serverless developers as a prominent. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding that can guide future implementations and advancements in the context of serverless migration.

AB Large, multi-element scintillation detectors are increasingly being used in neutron experiments, particularly at medium energies, to provide the coincidence requirements needed for kinematic constraints and background rejection. These arrays involve specialized techniques for event processing and calibration, and their development has created the need for new simulation programs. We describe the design and testing of such a program, including detailed discussions of procedures for event reconstruction, detector calibration, and resolution measurements for segmented detectors. The discussions are illustrated using a prototype array composed of three 51 x 16 x 4 cm3 planes, each consisting of four scintillator bars 51 cm in length. Comparisons are made to measurements obtained with tagged beams of neutrons and protons at energies of 100-200 MeV. Very good agreement is obtained for efficiencies, resolutions, energy losses, inter-element velocities, and angular distributions. The results allow detailed analyses of the effect of charge-particle vetos and the assumptions about carbon breakup reactions in organic scintillators.

AB Processing on-the-fly high volume of data streams is increasingly needed. To cope with the heterogeneity of this data, RDF model is more and more being adopted leading to plethora of RDF Stream Processing (RSP) systems and languages dealing with issues such as continuous querying, incremental reasoning and complex event processing (CEP). However, most of them has implemented centralized approaches and therefore suffer from some limitations as collaboration, sharing, expressiveness and scalability. Multi-agents systems have widely proven their worth and efficiency in particular their intrinsic decentralized property along with their cooperation and communication mechanism. In this paper we propose a new framework MAS4MEAN (Multi-Agent System for streaM rEAsoNing) based on a multi-agents model to embrace their benefits and tackle the challenges of increasing the scalability and ease of deployment in highly dynamic environments. A preliminary experimental evaluation with a real-world dataset show promising results when compared to an existing work.

DE Complex Event Processing; Event Driven Architecture; Rule Based Expert
   System; Knowledgebase; data streams
AB Recently Complex Event Processing has emerged as a lightweight way to monitor multiple data streams to identify events or patterns of interest. Complex Event Processing is a rule based technology. Rules which represent the patterns of interest are defined by domain experts. Existing CEP engines have limitation on addition, deletion and modification of rules. Rules are configured initially once and are not changed later. Some of the engines support initial configuration and occasionally support addition of rules at runtime using the polling mechanism. This paper proposes a dynamic CEP by making the rule engine adaptive by using Event driven or push based approach for updating the rules dynamically in the Complex Event Processing System at runtime. Event driven approach facilitates Knowledgebase to update rules without polling or observing any resource and hence enhances the system performance. The resulting CEP engine with dynamic infrastructure facilitates easy addition and deletion of the rules in an easy and efficient way.

AB In the past years the landscape of tools for expressing parallel algorithms in a portable way across various compute accelerators has continued to evolve significantly. There are many technologies on the market that provide portability between CPU, GPUs from several vendors, and in some cases even FPGAs. These technologies include C++ libraries such as Alpaka and Kokkos, compiler directives such as OpenMP, the SYCL open specification that can be implemented as a library or in a compiler, and standard C++ where the compiler is solely responsible for the offloading. Given this developing landscape, users have to choose the technology that best fits their applications and constraints. For example, in the CMS experiment the experience so far in heterogeneous reconstruction algorithms suggests that the full application contains a large number of relatively short computational kernels and memory transfer operations. In this work we use a stand-alone version of the CMS heterogeneous pixel reconstruction code as a realistic use case of HEP reconstruction software that is capable of leveraging GPUs effectively. We summarize the experience of porting this code base from CUDA to Alpaka, Kokkos, SYCL, std::par, and OpenMP offloading. We compare the event processing throughput achieved by each version on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs as well as on a CPU, and compare those to what a native version of the code achieves on each platform.

DE Data Stream Processing; Programming Languages; Throughput Performance
AB Stream-based data processing systems, such as Complex Event Processing or data stream mining systems, may be composed of several components which may be implemented in various programming languages. In distributed scenarios, computer networks typically represent important bottlenecks. However, the performance of data exchange in local contexts may be as important as the performance of data exchange via computer networks. Local programming language barriers may represent important bottlenecks for components that are located on the same computer system. In distributed scenarios, it may be beneficial to relocate components on a single physical host for exploiting the higher local data throughput. The properties of stream-based systems pose challenges like high throughput requirements but also open up optimization potential such as leveraging batched transfers. We performed an experimental analysis of ways for bridging local programming language barriers using the examples of C, Java, and Python and analyzed the impact of batched forwarding. While local data exchange can be expected to offer a higher throughput than exchange across networks, our results show that batch forwarding can increase the local throughput by factors of up to 47.6 and we measured net throughputs up to 39.5 Gbps.

ID SCALE
AB Distributed pub/sub messaging has become indispensable for event-driven systems. There are methods for achieving high scalability regarding topic-based pub/sub by using structured overlay networks. However, these methods waste network resources concerning "exhaust data," which have low or no value most of the time. There are at least two problems: each publisher node continues to forward data to a relay node even if there are no subscribers, and multicast trees are constructed which are excessively large for low value data, namely having a small number of subscribers. In this paper, we formulate the requirements of overlay networks by defining a property called "strong relay-free" as an expansion of relay-free property, and propose a practical method satisfying the property by using Skip Graph. The proposed method involves publishers and subscribers composing connected subgraphs to enable detecting the absence of subscribers and autonomously adjusting the tree size. Through simulation experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method can suspend publishing adaptively, and shorten the path length on multicast trees by more than 75% under an experimental condition with 100,000 nodes. The proposed method is competent for decentralized event-driven systems with encouraging the locally produced data to be consumed locally.

   DETECTORS; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; ANODES; SATELLITE
AB We describe a novel MCP imaging detector scheme using the Cross Strip (XS) anode. This anode uses charge division, and centroiding, of microchannel plate charge signals detected on two orthogonal layers of sense strips to encode event X-Y position, event time and signal amplitude. We have developed novel XS anode structures that will, in combination with a new generation of small pore MCP's (< 4 mu m pores), perform at the highest resolution levels (<10 mu m) with self triggered similar to 1 ns timing accuracy and encode photons at greater than 1 MHz; rates. Our development the XS charge division scheme has been demonstrated with formats up to 32mm(2). They show excellent resolution (better than 7 pm FWHM, actually imaging the MCP pores) using low MCP gain (5 x 10(5)). We have investigated XS anode structures that will accommodate a wide variety of forms (circular, square, rectangular). We are using this concept to produce open face and sealed tube detectors for imaging a wide range of photon and particle events.
   To encode event positions we have designed and built a parallel channel encoding electronics. The front end boards utilize two RD-20, 32 channel preamplifier ASICs. The preamplified signal is post-amplified on the same board in order to match the dynamic range of downstream 60 Msps ADCs that constantly digitize the signal for subsequent digital peak detection. Tests with eight 60 Msps ADC channels and a software Finite Impulse Response algorithm demonstrate <5 mu m electronic resolution and <10 mu m resolution with a 32mm XS anode detector. A full 64 channel 60 Msps ADC circuit has been constructed along with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA event processing board. In combination with firmware based Xilinx centroiding algorithms, encoding the event positions at more than 1 MHz rates over large areas should also be possible. Such detector system may be used for a variety of future missions, in solar, solar system and astronomical applications.

AB Microservice architecture has become increasingly popular due to its good maintainability, scalability, fault tolerance, and extensibility. In addition to the REST style of microservices that has been widely used, the event-driven style of microservices is also gaining more and more attention. However, the current software testing methods have little support for event-driven architecture, and the technical complexity of event-driven microservices has further increased the difficulty of testing. In this regard, we propose a software testing tool for event-driven microservice systems called CCTS (Composite Contract Testing Service). By combining consumer-driven contract testing and the event-driven state model, CCTS records the state transitions of event exchange between services, and automatically retrieves the possible transition paths among services. Simultaneously, CCTS analyzes the event logs from the target system to determine whether the event logs conformed with the specified transitions of states and retrieved paths. Besides, CCTS checks the validity of contract testing to ensure that the communication through services. To evaluate CCTS, we conducted functional testing for CCTS using a real-world microservice system. The results show that CCTS can effectively detect potential defects in the event-driven microservice system, such as isolated states, cyclic states, incomplete contract tests, and unqualified event sequences.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Mobile Adhoc networks (MANETs) are two technologies that can be used to enable monitoring applications for Emergency and Rescue missions (ER). MANETs are characterized by energy limitations, and in-network processing or distributed CEP is one possible solution. Operator placement mechanism for distributed CEP has a direct impact on energy consumption. Existing operator placement mechanisms focus on static network topologies and are therefore inappropriate for MANETs scenarios.
   We propose a novel energy efficient decentralized distributed placement mechanism, designed to achieve fast convergence with minimal data transmission cost while achieving a near optimal placement assignment.
   We compare our decentralized placement mechanism with a centralized approach under different mobility scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluate the distributed CEP under different workload scenarios in order to gain additional insight into different performance characteristics of the system. Finally, we measure the impact of a simple placement replication scheme on the overall system performance in terms of delay and message overhead.
   Our decentralized placement mechanism achieves up to almost 50% lower message overhead compared to the centralized approach, and it has lower message overhead across different mobility scenarios compared to the centralized approach. The placement replication scheme achieves up to 51% lower delay compared to the decentralized placement mechanism with no replication.

DE Complex Event Processing; Event Graph; Heuristic Priority Scheduling;
   Deadline
AB Complex event processing (CEP) plays an important role in developing responsive stream processing applications, with emphasis on "Velocity" from Big Data perspective. However, in emerging applications with heavyweight query requirements, the big rule set and the event coupling relationship could result in a complicated event graph. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art graph-based event processing approach employs the depth-first strategy and assumes that all complex events are equally important, which are more likely to reduce the scalability. In this paper, we focus on assigning priorities to complex events heuristically for the event graph model. The proposed priority dispatching policies take the following aspects into account: the topological particularity, the relative deadline and the dynamic process of event correlation, with the goal of minimizing the average response time. Furthermore, a priority-driven event scheduling strategy is presented, which aims to support real-time reasoning requirement. Finally, the experimental comparison with the standard graph-based event processing technique shows that the proposed event scheduling can yield a substantial improvement in the specific performances.

   and Social Media
AB Social media is an increasingly popular method for people to share information and interact with each other. Analysis of social media data has the potential to provide useful insights in a wide range of domains including social science, advertising and policing. Social media information is produced in real-time, and so analysis that can give insights into events as they occur can be particularly valuable. Similarly, analytics platforms providing low latency query responses can improve the user experience for ad-hoc data exploration on historic data sets. However, the rate at which new data is generated makes it a real challenge to design a system that can meet both of these challenges. This paper describes the deisgn and evaluation of such a system. Firstly, it describes how a meta-analysis of the types of questions that were being asked of Twitter data led to the identification of a small set of queries that could be used to answer the majority of them. Secondly, it describes the design of a scalable platform for answering these and other queries. The architecture is described: it is cloud-based, and combines both continuous query, and noSQL database technology. Evaluation results are presented which show that the system can scale to process queries on streaming data arriving at the rate of the full Twitter firehose. Experiments show that queries on large repositories of stored historic data can also be answered with low latency. Finally, we present the results of queries that combine both streaming and historic data.

ID PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS
AB We present an adaptive optical neural network based on a large-scale event-driven architecture. In addition to changing the synaptic weights (synaptic plasticity), the optical neural network's structure can also be reconfigured enabling various functionalities (structural plasticity). Key building blocks are wavelength-addressable artificial neurons with embedded phase-change materials that implement nonlinear activation functions and nonvolatile memory. Using multimode focusing, the activation function features both excitatory and inhibitory responses and shows a reversible switching contrast of 3.2 decibels. We train the neural network to distinguish between English and German text samples via an evolutionary algorithm. We investigate both the synaptic and structural plasticity during the training process. On the basis of this concept, we realize a large-scale network consisting of 736 subnetworks with 16 phase-change material neurons each. Overall, 8398 neurons are functional, highlighting the scalability of the photonic architecture.

AB Current communication systems restrict user affordances in terms of expressiveness and interaction. Complex Event Processing (CEP) have gained much importance to overcome these shortcomings. It allows users to interact with powerful expressiveness when defining logical and temporal patterns of exchanged events. This expressiveness allows cleaning network traffic by eliminating the routing of useless events and consequently reducing the overall consumed energy. However, handling the expressiveness of desired events, filtering coming events still challenging features, especially with the growth of data size encapsulated as events in the network. In this work, we rely on Publish/Subscribe system based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), which offers intrinsically flexible event routing, scalability and load balancing in order to manage distributed composite events routing. For efficient event filtering, we propose a three dimensional indexing hash space named CECube as a smart data structure for rapid CEP over DHT. The CECube indexes firstly composite subscriptions, then basing on a simple binary search, it serves as publications filter and helps making the right decision for what events should be aggregated and forwarded to the adequate subscribers.
   The performance of our solution is evaluated using FreePastry simulator. The results demonstrate firstly that our approach is efficient in terms of filtering process and that the average number of routing nodes is decreased. Secondly, we prove the superiority of our approach as compared to another existing work.

AB Evidence shows that people with high social anxiety levels ruminate about distressing social events, which contributes to the maintenance of social anxiety symptoms. The present study aimed to explore the role of shame in maintaining post-event rumination (PER) following a negative social event (an impromptu speech with negative feedback) in a student sample (N = 104). Participants reported negative rumination related to the event one day and one week after the speech. PER measured one day after the speech was not associated with social anxiety symptoms and state anxiety. One week later, participants with clinically relevant social anxiety symptoms experienced greater PER. State shame was the only significant predictor of PER in a regression equation that also included social anxiety symptoms, state anxiety and self-evaluation of performance. Possible explanations and implications are discussed in light of cognitive models of social anxiety.

DT Article
AB To assure rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, it's important to have scalable middleware that can abstract developers and users from the IoT infrastructure. Event processing systems could fill this gap between IoT infrastructure and application layers. However, semantic coupling poses a challenge to scalability in IoT's highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environment. Here, the authors propose a solution based on loosely coupled producers and consumers enabled with approximate semantic matching of events. This approach emphasizes a practitioner's perspective for building software that can tackle the heterogeneity of IoT events.

AB Post-event processing refers to negative and repetitive thinking following socially anxious situations and has been posited as a maintaining factor in social anxiety. One strategy for reducing post-event processing may be through self-compassion, which was the primary purpose of the present study. An additional aim was to examine the effect of self-compassion on willingness to engage in future social scenarios. Socially anxious undergraduates (N = 98) provided an impromptu speech and were randomly assigned to a self-compassion, rumination, or control condition. Participants completed measures of post-event processing and willingness to engage in social situations the following day. As expected, self-compassion immediately following a speech led to less post-event processing the next day, as well as greater willingness to engage in future social situations. There was also support for a mediation model illustrating the mechanisms through which self-compassion exerted its effects on these two outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of self-compassion on reducing the negative and repetitive thinking that serves to maintain social anxiety and increasing willingness to partake in future social events.

AB The trend that organizations are linking Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) efforts closely to real-time processes makes research and industrial community increasingly focus on the SOA and Event Stream Processing (ESP) connection. ESP needs to correlate multiple continuous events involved in complex temporal relationship and attribute logic relationship to more abstract complex events in richer semantic. Due to high speed arrival rate of events and vast volume of registered complex event queries, memory consumption and incremental event query evaluation demand a comprehensive dedicate event stream processing framework with low-latency and high scalability. In this paper, we study problems of query optimization for ESP, especially topics on temporal restriction query. We first propose a framework to integrate ESP features with business process management and monitor. We then describe a query plan-based approach to efficiently execute ESP queries. Our approach uses algebraic conversion to efficiently handle temporal restriction queries, which are a key component of complex event processing, and computes temporal relevance condition at compile time to obtain event relevance time for a given expression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a performance evaluation of our prototype implementation.

AB Software has spent the bounty of Moore's law by solving harder problems and exploiting abstractions, such as high-level languages, virtual machine technology, binary rewriting, and dynamic analysis. Abstractions make programmers more productive and programs more portable, but usually slow them down. Since Moore's law is now delivering multiple cores instead of faster processors, future systems must either bear a relatively higher cost for abstractions or use some cores to help tolerate abstraction costs.
   This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel concurrent, configurable dynamic analysis framework that efficiently utilizes multicore cache architectures. It introduces Cache-friendly Asymmetric Buffering (CAB), a lock-free ring-buffer that implements efficient communication between application and analysis threads. We guide the design and implementation of our framework with a model of dynamic analysis overheads. The framework implements exhaustive and sampling event processing and is analysis-neutral. We evaluate the framework with five popular and diverse analyses, and show performance improvements even for lightweight, low-overhead analyses.
   Efficient inter-core communication is central to high performance parallel systems and we believe the CAB design gives insight into the subtleties and difficulties of attaining it for dynamic analysis and other parallel software.

AB Efficient event processing is fundamental for IoT systems handling critical data such as security surveillance and e-health. There is a need for data real time processing and accurate classification of events following their security level. These tasks are challenging in IoT context systems which handle a big volume of multimedia data. They require a large processing time and event consumers have different points of interest and multi-level access rights. In this paper, we propose AMSEP for multi-level security management of multimedia events. AMSEP automatically analyses incoming multimedia events, calculates their security levels following multi-level security policies in order to send them securely to their destinations. The proposed system is based on Deep Learning processing and on a publish/subscribe broker extension (Kafka). We show that mixing the two building blocks allows to fulfill three main challenges in IoT: (1) Accurate and real time event processing, (2) Dynamic adaptation to modify security policies and (3) event scalability and reliable routing of events from sources to destinations.

AB Streaming data analytics has become increasingly vital in many applications such as dynamic content delivery (e.g., advertisements), Twitter sentiment analysis, and security event processing (e.g., intrusion detection systems, and spam filters). Emerging stream processing systems, such as Spark Streaming, treat the continuous stream as a series of micro-batches of data and continuously process these micro-batch jobs. Such micro-batch based stream processing provides several advantages over traditional stream processing systems, which process streaming data one record at a time, including fast recovery from failures, better load balancing and scalability. However, efficient scheduling of micro-batch jobs to achieve high throughput and low latency is very challenging due to the complex data dependency and dynamism inherent in streaming workloads. In this paper, we propose A-scheduler, an adaptive scheduling approach that dynamically schedules parallel micro-batch jobs in Spark Streaming and automatically adjusts scheduling parameters to improve performance and resource efficiency. Specifically, A-scheduler dynamically schedules multiple jobs concurrently using different policies based on their data dependencies and automatically adjusts the level of job parallelism and resource shares among jobs based on workload properties. We implemented A-scheduler and evaluated it with a real-time security event processing workload. Our experimental results show that A-scheduler can reduce end-to-end latency by 42% and improve workload throughput and energy efficiency by 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to the default Spark Streaming scheduler.

AB An e-market can be thought of as a distributed event system where an event is generated every time the market's state changes in response to a number of human or computing agents. The paper describes a practical application of event processing in an e-market context through conventional Event Processing Systems (EPSs). A new EPS architecture that allows the integration of several existing EPSs under a unified domain-specific user interface and execution environment is proposed. We assess the performance of a prototype system for a case study in financial market surveillance and its ability to provide a common interface for two existing EPSs-SMARTS and Coral8. A discussion on the experimental results and the issues arising from the proposed EPS architecture are also provided.

AB Effectively developing complex distributed systems of interacting devices has challenged the state of the art for many years. Practical application domains like hunting for mines in the ocean using collaborating groups of unmanned, underwater vehicles have underscored the need for not only better programming languages for scalable distributed system design but also better development, modeling and visualization tools that enable the developers to more rapidly identify and avoid problems, then converge on viable solutions. The Command, Communication and Computation Language (C3L) was developed specifically for this application and utilizes a purely asynchronous, discrete-event driven architecture to achieve formal controllability and behavioral properties specifically for the application domain of unmanned, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) participating in a Mine Counter-Measures (MCM) mission. In such applications, collaborating AUVs act as a distributed system of autonomous agents. Effectively programming distributed systems has proven to be technically challenging, requiring a language with a foundation of strong controllability properties, the computational expressiveness approaching a general-purpose language and the ability to easily express communication between devices. C3L, abstracts the complexities of communication and distributed control into a unified framework based on raising events, freeing the application developer from the tedious tasks of programming lower-level functionality and allowing him or her to focus on the higher-level behavioral requirements of the mission. The C3L, language also features a rigorous yet intuitive plant model that explicitly designates state-space variables and procedures controlling precisely how controllable aspects of the state-space may change. This programming paradigm enables the developer to take a design that begins as a mathematical model and implement it almost directly as a program for evaluation. A compiler based on the Microsoft Phoenix framework for compiler design and optimization has been created to take C3L, programs and generate executable code for either simulation studies or for direct implementation on actual hardware. This compiler automatically extracts task-level parallelism inherent in C3L, programs and generates a multi-threaded application with no explicit actions required by the programmer; such applications are ideal for the multicore and many-core processors of today's and tomorrow's computers and embedded controllers.
   In complex, distributed systems, visualizations of performance and behaviors can be critically important to the overall utility of the application in either simulation studies or in actual applications. To best position C3L as a powerful language for modeling and implementing such systems, the Visualization Tool Kit (VTK) was integrated with the C3L compiler. This permits a C3L program to generate directly powerful, 4-D presentations of data in a fully configurable way. Figure I illustrates a representative screen shot of such a visualization, depicting two collaborating AUVs in a MCM mission in a section of the Chesapeake Bay. The bathymetry was generated directly from NOAA echo depth sounding data in a text-based XYZ format; such data is freely downloadable from the Internet. Functions were created to convert the latitude and longitude data from the depth sounding data to meters, and then convert the irregularly-spaced depth sounding data to a surface using a filtered 2D Delaunay triangulation. The complexity of the resulting surface may be reduced using a quadric decimation filter if desired. Consequently, a C3L-based simulation or application may include visualizations not only of the 'actors' in the distributed system but also in a realistic scenario capable of utilizing actual bathymetry.
   We present the visualization support integrated into the C3L compiler and describe the language extensions developed to leverage these capabilities in either simulation studies or in actual implementations. We show how the C3L language and its visualization-enabled compiler allow distributed system development to go from a purely mathematical state-based model through simulation studies directly to actual implementations. Finally, we present an example application from the mathematically model through a C3L simulation implementation.

AB Event processing (EP) is a data processing technology that conducts online processing of event information. In this survey, we summarize the latest cutting-edge work done on EP from both industrial and academic research community viewpoints. We divide the entire field of EP into three subareas: EP system architectures, EP use cases, and EP open research topics. Then we deep dive into the details of each subsection. We investigate the system architecture characteristics of novel EP platforms, such as Apache Storm, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. We found significant advancements made on novel application areas, such as the Internet of Things; streaming machine learning (ML); and processing of complex data types such as text, video data streams, and graphs. Furthermore, there has been significant body of contributions made on event ordering, system scalability, development of EP languages and exploration of use of heterogeneous devices for EP, which we investigate in the latter half of this article. Through our study, we found key areas that require significant attention from the EP community, such as Streaming ML, EP system benchmarking, and graph stream processing.

AB Physical event detection has long been the domain of static event processors operating on numeric sensor data. This works well for large scale strong-signal events such as hurricanes, and important classes of events such as earthquakes. However, for a variety of domains there is insufficient sensor coverage, e.g., landslides, wild-fires, and flooding. Social networks have provided massive volume of data from billions of users, but data from these generic social sensors contain much more noise than physical sensors. One of the most difficult challenges presented by social sensors is concept drift, where the terms associated with a phenomenon evolve and change over time, rendering static machine learning (ML) classifiers less effective. To address this problem, we develop the ASSED (Adaptive Social Sensor Event Detection) framework with an ML-based event processing engine and show how it can perform simple and complex physical event detection on strong- and weak-signal with low-latency, high scalability, and accurate coverage. Specifically, ASSED is a framework to support continuous filter generation and updates with machine learning using streaming data from high-confidence sources (physical and annotated sensors) and social networks. We build ASSED to support procedures for integrating high-confidence sources into social sensor event detection to generate high-quality filters and to perform dynamic filter selection by tracking its own performance. We demonstrate ASSED capabilities through a landslide detection application that detects almost 350% more landslides compared to static approaches. More importantly, ASSED automates the handling of concept drift: four years after initial data collection and classifier training, ASSED achieves event detection accuracy of 0.988 (without expert manual intervention), compared to 0.762 for static approaches.

AB The turn of phrase that best summarizes SERKET's main goal is to provide security personnel with the right information at the right time. For this aim, the SERKET security system incorporates mechanisms to collect, fuse, filter and aggregate information coming from heterogeneous event sources and sensors. This Complex Event Processing is performed to improve the global situation awareness and the management of threats. Additionally, the system is intended to be as open, flexible and scalable as possible at a low cost. In this paper, the mechanisms by means of which scalability and flexibility features are achieved in the particular issue of sensors management are shown. Moreover, instead of simply homogenizing basic events and delegating their processing to higher levels of the system, it builds, as far as possible, a picture of the local situation. Therefore, the traffic to the rest of the system can be reduced since this local situation picture is transferred instead of many events that are too basic.

AB Works in the field of data warehousing (DW) do not address Stream Processing (SP) integration in order to provide results freshness (i.e. results that include information that is not yet stored into the DW) and at the same time to relax the DW processing load. Previous research works focus mainly on parallelization, for instance: adding more hardware resources; parallelizing operators, queries, and storage. A very known and studied approach is to use Map-Reduce to scale horizontally in order to achieve more storage and processing performance. In many contexts, high-rate data needs to be processed in small time windows without storing results (e.g. for near real-time monitoring), in other cases, the objective is to relax the data warehouse usage (e.g. keeping results updated for web-pages reload). In both cases, stream processing solutions can be set to work together with the data warehouse (Map-Reduce or not) to keep results available on the fly avoiding high query execution times, and, this way leaving the DW servers more available to process other heavy tasks (e.g. data mining).
   In this work, we propose the integration of Stream Processing and Map-Reduce (MRSP) for better query and DW performance. This approach allows to relax the data warehouse load, and, by consequence reducing the network usage. This mechanism integrates into Map-Reduce scalability mechanisms and uses the Map-Reduce nodes to process Stream queries.
   Results show/compare performance gains on the DW side and the quality of experience (QoE) when executing queries and loading data.

AB In this era of big and fast data, software architects tend to find it really hard to make consistent decisions about which architecture and technologies are ideal for a certain business need. It is even harder to make them while dealing with the scarcity of clear methodologies, best practices and reference architectures. In this prospect, architecture evaluation through benchmarking can be of great interest, as it enables the detection of performance anomalies or bottlenecks as you go. The problem when talking about Big Data benchmarking, is that existing solutions remain technology-related, and do not deal with the heterogeneous aspect of complex architectures. In addition to that, businesses are in general dealing with multi-layered complex systems, involving various technologies, paradigms and micro-architectures. This means that the benchmarking solution must be able to give fine-grained insights about each of the layers. A successful benchmarking system must also be seamless, easy to use, scalable, and preferably cloud native. To satisfy these requirements, we designed and implemented Babel, a generic Big Data benchmarking platform, that insures an end-to-end performance evaluation and monitoring. We present in this paper the principles, architecture, integration and deployment steps of Babel. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As Cyber Physical-Internet of Things Systems (CPS-IoT Systems) continue to advance, we have noticed an expansion of the variety of entity types deployed in these systems. With this expansion, the complexity of handling vastly different communication protocols, processes, and data within the system in a timely manner has become a significant challenge. One potential method of quickly processing this data is to push essential computation concerning the Transitional State Change (TSC) feedback loop from the cloud to the edge of the system. In this paper, we propose DRAEC, a novel edge computing framework that uses agent-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Complex-Event Processing (CEP) to significantly decrease the latency of the TSC feedback loop and subsequently increase the system's scalability. This increase in performance is achieved by using a CEP system to synthesize discreet events from CPS-IoT entity telemetry, which our novel Dynamic Reactive Agent then uses to quickly generate and enforce controls on a user's physical environment via a user-defined operational policy. We then present supporting results, showing that our novel edge computing framework enables a CPS-IoT control system to outperform a cloud-centric variant by 20-43x (depending on the connection type) when comparing the latency of the TSC feedback loop; it also enables support of significantly larger scale (10-100x) systems while maintaining the same level of service as the cloud-centric version.

AB Event sourcing is increasingly used and implemented in event-based systems for maintaining the evolution of application state. However, unbounded event logs are impracticable for many systems, as it is difficult to align scalability requirements and long-term runtime behavior with the corresponding storage requirements. To this end, we explore the design space of log pruning approaches suitable for event-sourced systems. Furthermore, we survey specific log pruning mechanisms for event-sourced logs. In a brief evaluation, we point out the trade-offs when applying pruning to event logs and highlight the applicability of log pruning to event-sourced systems.

AB An e-market can be thought of as a distributed event system where an event is generated every time the market's state changes in response to a number of human or computing agents. The paper describes a practical application of event processing in an e-market context through conventional Event Processing Systems (EPSs). A new EPS architecture that allows an integration of several existing EPSs under a unified domain-specific user interface and execution environment is proposed. We assess the performance of the system for a case study in financial market surveillance and its ability to provide a common interface for two existing EPSs - SMARTS and Coral8. A discussion on the experimental results and the issues arising from the proposed EPS architecture are also provided.

AB This paper presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) classifier architecture for enabling always-on artificial intelligent (AI) functions, such as keyword spotting (KWS) and visual wake-up, in ultra-low-power internet-of-things (IoT) devices. Such always-on hardware tends to dominate the power efficiency of an IoT device and therefore it is paramount to minimize its power dissipation. A key observation is that the input signal to always-on hardware is typically sparse in time. This is a great opportunity that a SNN classifier can leverage because the switching activity and the power consumption of SNN hardware can scale with spike rate. To leverage this scalability, the proposed SNN classifier architecture employs event-driven architecture, especially fine-grained clock generation and gating and fine-grained power gating, to obtain very low static power dissipation. The prototype is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS and occupies an area of 1.99 mm(2). At 0.52 V supply voltage, it consumes 75 nW at no input activity and less than 300 nW at 100% input activity. It still maintains competitive inference accuracy for KWS and other always-on classification workloads. The prototype achieved a power consumption reduction of over three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art for SNN hardware and of about 2.3X compared to the state-of-the-art KWS hardware.

AB Air pollution (AP) is a major problem for public health. To reduce effect of AP, air quality monitoring stations are deployed world-wide. But in addition to monitoring, by predicting air pollution levels, peoples exposure to pollution can be further reduced. In this work, we firstly review air quality (AQ) prediction literature in an algorithmic point-of-view. Then we introduce a new AQ prediction framework. The proposed framework utilizes Complex Event Processing to process huge amount of data in near real time. Fog Computing is utilized to achieve scalability, extendibility and Software Defined Network utilized to enhance manageability of the network. In this paper, we explain the network architecture and methodology behind the framework. The proposed framework can operate in near real time and does not need any human assistance.

AB Large number of sensors are running in the high performance computer (HPC, supercomputer) environment to detect the hardware and software resource utilization during the jobs execution. Different state variables of the HPC system are detected by physical sensors but virtual sensors are producing important event information, as well. By measuring sensor data of different processes huge amount of state information is collected from the supercomputer during the execution time. Each of the time series collected in this way have special meaning and characterize the utilization of a given HPC resource subset. Having dozens of time series collected in parallel for each of the 128 computation nodes, complex event processing (CSP) methods are needed to evaluate the jobs execution efficiency. This paper gives a complex overview of a resource utilization analysis of 18 TFLOPS capacity HPC system with 1.5 thousand CPU cores. Advanced method is presented based on neural networks for defining clusters of the strongly correlated variables with 55 thousand samples each. Selection procedure of the representing variable needed for each cluster. Method based on statistical analysis is proposed to evaluate jobs execution efficiency by the HPC system.

AB The event processing system discussed in this paper updates target objects' state according to corresponding events. It is widely used in areas such as activity monitoring, business process automation, and business object state management. Existing event driven systems usually employ centralized single-server architecture, which is not scalable, elastic or robust enough to handle highly dynamic workload. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based event driven system that is highly scalable and elastic, and can tolerate even severe system failures. Our event driven system takes advantage of cloud technologies and adopts a completely distributed architecture. It therefore can scale to large number of servers in the cloud quickly with minimum administration overhead. Results from extensive evaluations show that our system's performance grows almost linearly with the number of servers in the system. Our system performs more than one order of magnitude better than a full-replication-based distributed event driven system of the same system scale.

AB The existing capacity to collect, store, process and analyze huge amounts of data that is rapidly generated, i.e., Big Data, is characterized by fast technological developments and by a limited set of conceptual advances that guide researchers and practitioners in the implementation of Big Data systems. New data stores or processing tools frequently appear, proposing new (and usually more efficient) ways to store and query data (like SQL-on-Hadoop). Although very relevant, the lack of common methodological guidelines or practices has motivated the implementation of Big Data systems based on use-case driven approaches. This is also the case for one of the most valuable organizational data assets, the Data Warehouse, which needs to be rethought in the way it is designed, modeled, implemented, managed and monitored. This paper addresses some of the research challenges in Big Data Warehousing systems, proposing a vision that looks into: (i) the integration of new business processes and data sources; (ii) the proper way to achieve this integration; (iii) the management of these complex data systems and the enhancement of their performance; (iv) the automation of some of their analytical capabilities with Complex Event Processing and Machine Learning; and, (v) the flexible and highly customizable visualization of their data, providing an advanced decision-making support environment.

AB The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allow citizens to control their data. For that, they must define and update their security data policies that are generally more sophisticated and more dynamic than classical access control policies managed by system administrators. Consequently, GDPR implementation in modern scalable and dynamic systems like IoT is still a challenge. We propose a security model for data privacy and an original solution where a GDPR consent manager is integrated using Complex Event Processing (CEP) system and following the edge computing. We show, through a smart home IoT system, the efficiency of our approach in terms of flexibility and scalability.

AB CEP and Databases share some characteristics but traditionally are treated as two separate worlds, one oriented towards real-time event processing and the later oriented towards long-term data management. However many real-time data and business intelligence analysis do need to confront streaming data with long-term stored one. For instance, how do current power consumption and power grid distribution compare with last year's for the same day?
   StreamNetFlux is a novel system that recently emerged to the market designed to integrate CEP and database functionalities. This blending allows the processing of queries that need such capabilities with top efficiency and scalability features.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB The use of real-time data streams in data-driven computational science is driving the need for stream processing tools that work within the architectural framework of the larger application. Data stream processing systems are beginning to emerge in the commercial space, but these systems fail to address the needs of large-scale scientific applications. In this paper we illustrate the unique needs of large-scale data driven computational science through an example taken from weather prediction and forecasting. We apply a realistic workload from this application against our Calder stream processing system to determine effective throughput, event processing latency, data access scalability, and deployment latency.(1).

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a promising approach for real-time processing of big data streams originating from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Even though scalability and flexibility are key issues for IoT applications, current studies are mostly based on centralized solutions and restrictive query languages. Moreover, development, deployment and operation of big-data applications require significant amount of technical expertise. Hence, a framework that provides a higher abstraction level programming model and a streamlined execution environment is essential to facilitate widespread user adoption. In this paper, we propose a data-flow based visual programming model that enables development of big-data applications in IoT domain even by users who have limited or no experience in big-data technologies. A scalable CEP engine is also devised to execute the applications developed using this language. A prototype is implemented by using the state-of-the-art big-data and real-time stream processing technologies to evaluate the applicability and usability of the framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) technology presents a complex and challenging paradigm where a huge amount of noisy raw sensor data is collected in order to observe and detect critical events occurring on the system, and generate alarms when required. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices connected through the network. In addifion, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT systems. A survey performed on existing prior arts on quantifying uncertainty for complex events concluded that proposed existing solutions are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming data. This paper presents a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition (both complex event processing and probabilistic programming) to handle IoT systems uncertainty. In addifion, the paper analyzes and recommends existing big data platforms for processing complex events in IoT systems. The current focus of our work includes research and development of the optimized deadline-based and cost-effective resource allocation algorithm in Apache Spark for Uncertain IoT Notification systems.

AB Many sophisticated technologies and solutions exist or are being developed to address topics such as sensor data modeling, data fusion, and threat processing. To make an operational impact, however, these technologies and solutions must be linked to the relevant data sources and tailored to the operator needs in the Space Command and Control and Space Situational Awareness mission areas. Therefore we propose a holistic, mission-driven approach for data integration, with three key tenets to address industry challenges:
   Net-Centric data exposure and access through well-defined SOA web service interfaces
   Push-pull data integration based on an Event-Driven Architecture
   Augmented data understanding through mission-driven capability analysis
   The centerpiece of the framework is an Event-Driven Data Integration Environment (EDDIE) that serves as a broker between mission-specific data needs and various data providers. Leveraging the emerging Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technologies, this layer provides a combination of on-demand "pull" of relevant information by an end user and the event-driven "push" of time-sensitive information to support decision making. Architecturally, this loosely-coupled framework is based on Net-Centric tenets and industry/DoD standards, allowing new tools and data sources to be ingested and evolve over time. The results of the event driven architecture framework enable the required C2 performance thresholds and objectives as well as a repeatable integration structure.'

AB This paper presents a framework for simulation-based assessment of next-generation IoT-enabled supply chains with a focus on perishable dairy products. The framework integrates real-time data capturing with supply chain modelling and dynamic performance management. The concept of complex event processing (CEP) is utilised to implement IoT functionality. The aim is to reduce waste and losses caused by outdated items, shortages, and inventory discrepancies. The approach is illustrated through a simulation of dairy products perishability in a three-echelon supply chain. Simulation experiments were used to assess the impact of enabling two IoT functionalities; adjusting quantities distributed to retailers based on shelf-life and moving dairy products amongst retailers based on the proximity of their expiration. Simulation results have shown substantial improvement in both economic and operational KPIs of dairy products perishability. Results were also used to trade-off the percentage of expired milk and the inventory fill-rate. [Submitted: 6 August 2020; Accepted: 1 December 2020]

TI Subscription Normalization for Effective Content-Based Messaging

AB Efficient subscription summarization and event matching is key to the scalability of content-based publish/subscribe networks (CPSNs). Current summarization and event matching mechanisms based on subscription subsumption induce heavy event processing load on brokers degrading the performance of CPSNs especially under high rates of churn, i.e., addition, deletion, or modification of subscriptions. Yet, many modern CPS applications such as location-based services or algorithmic trading inherently rely on high frequency subscription changes. This paper describes Beretta, a dynamic CPSN which sustains high throughput and low event-propagation latencies even under a high frequency of subscription changes. Beretta leverages strong event typing and represents all subscriptions in a normalized form as combinations of value intervals and set inclusions without compromising on expressiveness. Beretta's "split and subsume" broker algorithm reduces the complexity of matching an event from O(K N) to O(K log N + vertical bar result vertical bar), with N being the number of subscriptions for the event type and K the number of its attributes. Event types and normalization are exploited to split subscriptions into predicates on individual event types and attributes and to efficiently regroup these in segment trees and hash maps which yield excellent subsumption properties and support attribute-wise split filtering during event matching. Normalization enables the systematic introduction of parameters into subscriptions to support both parametric and structural updates. This paper also empirically demonstrates the performance improvements due to our techniques through realistic algorithmic trading and highway traffic monitoring benchmarks.

AB The ability to promptly and efficiently detect arbitrarily complex patterns in massive real-time data streams is a crucial requirement in many modern applications. The ever-growing scale of these applications and the sophistication of the patterns involved makes it imperative to employ advanced solutions that can optimize pattern detection. One of the most prominent and well-established ways to achieve the above goal is to apply complex event processing (CEP) in a parallel manner, using a multi-core machine and/or a distributed environment. However, the inherent tightly coupled nature of CEP severely limits the scalability of the parallelization methods currently available.
   In this paper, we introduce a novel parallelization mechanism for efficient complex event processing over data streams. This mechanism is based on a hybrid two-tier model combining multiple layers of parallelism. By employing a fine-grained load balancing model, this multi-layered approach leads to a substantial increase in event detection throughput, while at the same time reducing the latency and the memory consumption. An extensive experimental evaluation on multiple real-life datasets shows that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CEP parallelization methods by a factor of two to three orders of magnitude.

AB High availability in complex distributed systems is a challenge that has lobe considered not only at design time, but also at execution time. This paper proposes an automatized monitoring architecture, event driven, based in rules with the goal of minimizing systems unavailability. Translating the expertise that operators have to rules, and providing an appropriate interface for services operation, allow us to execute self-healing actions to anticipate or correct fault cases as quickly as possible.

AB New particle/nuclear physics experiments require a massive amount of computing power that is only achieved by using high performance clusters directly connected to the data acquisition systems and integrated into the online systems of the experiments. However, integrating an HPC cluster into the online system of an experiment means: Managing and synchronizing thousands of processes that handle the huge throughput.
   In this work, modular components that can be used to build and integrate such a HPC cluster in the experiment control systems (ECS) will be introduced.
   The Online Device Control library (ODC) [1] in combination with the Dynamic Deployment System (DDS) [2, 3] and FairMQ [4] message queuing library offers a sustainable solution for integrating HPC cluster controls into an ECS.
   DDS as part of the ALFA framework [5] is a toolset that automates and significantly simplifies a dynamic deployment of user-defined processes and their dependencies on any resource management system (RMS) using a given process graph (topology).
   ODC, in this architecture, is the tool to control and communicate with a topology of FairMQ processes using DDS. ODC is designed to act as a broker between a high level experiment control system and a low level task management system e.g.: DDS.
   In this work the architecture of both DDS and ODC will be discussed, as well as the design decisions taken based on the experience gained of using these tools in production by the ALICE experiment at CERN to deploy and control thousands of processes (tasks) on the Event Processing Nodes cluster (EPN) during Run3 as a part of the ALICE O2 software ecosystem [6].

AB With the development of telemedicine, it is possible for doctors and patients to interact remotely, allowing patients with different diagnoses to seek expert care from thousands of kilometres away. Consequently, new scalability issues arise: interoperability of system components, data inaccuracies, and transmission errors. Medical information systems tend to automate routine processes in order to reduce the burden on operators and doctors. However, erroneous and incorrect records are not processed by the system in most cases. So, configuring verification rules with this specificity in mind is crucial to obtain correct and non-redundant information. In this paper, we consider a model of an information system within remote monitoring for patients suffering from arterial hypertension. As will be shown, existing rules for processing events triggered by blood pressure measurements over-react to any changes in patient health state. We developed new event-processing rules based on descriptive statistics and the average real variability and compared them with the initial guideline in patient measurements simulation. Processing the data with new regulations in the proposed framework can help significantly reduce the number of triggered events. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Networks of the Internet of Things (IoT) nowadays find greater widespread in many domains. Particularities of creation of IoT make the problem of their security monitoring rather actual; it is caused by necessity of processing of big amounts of heterogeneous data in real time. The problem may be solved by means of implementation of the parallel system for security data processing within IoT on the fly basing on complex event processing (CEP) technology. The paper considers basic solutions for creating such a system. The proposed system is oriented for usage of software environment Hadoop and includes data collection, data storage, data normalization and analysis, and data visualization components. The paper discusses the issues of architecture of this system, its implementation and experimental estimation. The experiments showed that the proposed approach to creation of the system on the basis of CEP technology provides suitable scalability and is capable to meet the requirements of processing data on security events in real time in IoT.

DE Complex event processing; Cloud computing; Predictive analytics
AB Many Big Data technologies were built to enable the processing of human generated data, setting aside the enormous amount of data generated from Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions and Internet-of Things (IoT) platforms. Such interactions create real-time data streams that are much more structured, often in the form of series of event occurrences. In this paper, we provide an overview on the main research issues confronted by existing Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques, with an emphasis on query optimization aspects. Our study expands on both deterministic and probabilistic event models and spans from centralized to distributed network settings. In that, we cover a wide range of approaches in the CEP domain and review the current status of techniques that tackle efficient query processing. These techniques serve as a starting point for developing Big Data oriented CEP applications. Therefore, we further study the issues that arise upon trying to apply those techniques over Big Data enabling technologies, as is the case with cloud platforms. Furthermore, we expand on the synergies among Predictive Analytics and CEP with an emphasis on scalability and elasticity considerations in cloud platforms with potentially dispersed resource pools.

AB The great advance and affordability of technologies, communications and sensor technology has led to the generation of large amounts of data in the field of the Internet of Things and smart environments, as well as a great demand for smart applications and services adapted to the specific needs of each individual. This has entailed the need for systems capable of receiving, routing and processing large amounts of data to detect situations of interest with low latency, but despite the many existing works in recent years, studying highly scalable and low latency data processing systems is still necessary. In this area, the efficiency of complex event processing (CEP) technology is of particular significance and has been used in a variety of application scenarios. However, in most of these scenarios there is no performance evaluation to show how the system performs under various loads and therefore the developer is challenged to develop such CEP-based systems in new scenarios without knowing how the system will be able to handle different input data rates and address scalability and fault tolerance. This article aims to fill this gap by providing an evaluation of the various versions of one of the most reputable CEP engines-Esper CEP, as well as its integration with two renowned messaging brokers for data ingestion-RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka. For this purpose, we defined a benchmark with a series of event patterns with some of the most representative operators of the Esper CEP engine and we performed a series of tests with an increasing rate of input data to the system. We did this for three alternative software architectures: integrating open-source Esper and RabbitMQ, integrating one instance of Esper enterprise edition with Apache Kafka, and integrating two distributed instances of Esper enterprise edition with Apache Kafka. We measured the usage of CPU, RAM memory, latency and throughput time, looking for the data input rate with which the system overloads for each event pattern and we compared the results of the three proposed architectures. The results have shown a very low CPU consumption for all implementation options and input data rates; a balanced memory usage, quite similar among the three architectures, up to an input rate of 10,000 or 15,000 events per second, depending on the architecture and event pattern, and a quite efficient response time up to 10,000 or 15,000 events per second, depending on the architecture and event pattern. Based on a more exhaustive analysis of results, we have concluded that the different options offered by Esper for CEP provide very efficient solutions for real-time data processing, although each with its limitations in terms of brokers to be used for data integration, scalability, and fault tolerance; a number of suggestions have been drawn out for the developer to take as a basis for choosing which CEP engine and which messaging broker to use for the implementation depending on the of the system in question.

AB Patient wait times and care service times are key performance measures for care processes in hospitals. Managing the quality of care delivered by these processes in real-time is challenging. A key challenge is to correlate source medical events to infer the care process states that define patient wait times and care service times. Commercially available complex event processing engines do not have built in support for the concept of care process state. This makes it unnecessarily complex to define and maintain rules for inferring states from source medical events in a care process. In this paper, we introduce a state monitoring engine for inferring and managing states based on an application model for care process monitoring. The research is validated with a case study developed in collaboration with a large community hospital.

AB In this paper we discuss a Grid-based Event Processing System (GEPS). Data intensive problems broadly exist in many scientific computational areas; usually their needs for super storage and computing capacities are difficult to be fully satisfied. Meanwhile the Globus Toolkit has become the de facto standard of building high performance distributed computing environments. Event processing and filtering is a kind of data intensive problem in high-energy physics area. Using the Globus grid toolkit, we have constructed the GEPS system, which provides web-based access to grid computing environments for event processing. Performance result indicates that event processing and filtering can be effectively implemented on GEPS.

AB Research has demonstrated that self-focused thoughts and negative affect have a reciprocal relationship [Mor, N., Winquist, J. (2002). Self-focused attention and negative affect: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 128, 638-662]. In the anxiety disorder literature, post-event processing has emerged as a specific construction of repetitive self-focused thoughts that pertain to social anxiety disorder. Post-event processing can be defined as an individual's repeated consideration and potential reconstruction Of his performance following a social situation. Post-event processing can also occur when an individual anticipates a social or performance event and begins to brood about other, past social experiences. The present review examined the post-event processing literature in an attempt to organize and highlight the significant results. The methodologies employed to study post-event processing have included self-report measures, daily diaries, social or performance situations created in the laboratory, and experimental manipulations of post-event processing or anticipation of an upcoming event. Directions for future research on post-event processing are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The DEBS Grand Challenge (GC) is a programming competition integrated into the annual ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event -Based Systems (DEBS) since DEBS 2011. The DEBS GC 2024 edition focuses on analyzing real-world telemetry data about over 200k hard drives in data centers. The goal of the challenge is to continuously compute clusters of similar drives as new data is received. This kind of analysis may be relevant to quickly identify groups of drives with a high probability of failure and enact predictive maintenance strategies. The submitted solutions are evaluated based on their design, performance, efficiency, ease of reuse, fault -tolerance, and adaptation to different problems. This paper describes the domain of telemetry data for hard drives, the data set used in the challenge, the specific problem formulation, and CHALLENGER platform used to evaluate the submissions.

AB Offloading the most demanding parts of applications to an edge GPU server cluster to save power or improve the result quality is a solution that becomes increasingly realistic with new networking technologies. In order to make such a computing scheme feasible, an application programming layer that can provide both low latency and scalable utilization of remote heterogeneous computing resources is needed. To this end, we propose a latency-optimized scalable distributed heterogeneous computing runtime implementing the standard OpenCL API.
   In the proposed runtime, network-induced latency is reduced by means of peer-to-peer data transfers and event synchronization as well as a streamlined control protocol implementation. Further improvements can be obtained streaming of source data directly from the producer device to the compute cluster. Compute cluster scalability is improved by distributing the command and event processing responsibilities to remote compute servers. We also show how a simple optional dynamic content size buffer OpenCL extension can significantly speed up applications that utilize variable length data.
   For evaluation we present a smartphone-based augmented reality rendering case study which, using the runtime, receives 19x improvement in frames per second and 17x improvement in energy per frame when offloading parts of the rendering workload to a nearby GPU server. The remote kernel execution latency overhead of the runtime is only 60 ms on top of the network roundtrip time. The scalability on multi-server multi-GPU clusters is shown with a distributed large matrix multiplication application.

AB This paper deals with the issue of interoperability of heterogeneous sensor systems and the availability of their data from a global perspective. We show the application of previously developed WEDA architecture style into a GIS based experimental system and we present the performance analysis results of the system. The paper also presents its strengths as being a firewall-friendly, web-standards based solution that can be plugged into existing applications without needing to completely rewrite them (which is good when using OGC Sensor Web Enablement services). The paper compares the new style with styles which are used today in OGC Webservices. We then present an alpha version of the experimental system with eventing enhancements that are available with the new style. These principles will be applied from the experimental system to the final draft specification and API after more tests. If such a web-service standard meets the new binding possibilities, alerting will become widely accessible and GIS viewers and sensors can improve user-experience, loading/publishing sensor data or loading pipelined WMS tiles as well.

AB Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) is a paradigm to infer the occurrence of complex situations in the surrounding world from basic events like sensor readings. In doing so, DCEP operators detect event patterns on their incoming event streams. To yield high operator throughput, data parallelization frameworks divide the incoming event streams of an operator into overlapping windows that are processed in parallel by a number of operator instances. In doing so, the basic assumption is that the different windows can be processed independently from each other. However, consumption policies enforce that events can only be part of one pattern instance; then, they are consumed, i.e., removed from further pattern detection. That implies that the constituent events of a pattern instance detected in one window are excluded from all other windows as well, which breaks the data parallelism between different windows. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of speculation: Based on the likelihood of an event's consumption in a window, subsequent windows may speculatively suppress that event. We propose the SPECTRE framework for speculative processing of multiple dependent windows in parallel. Our evaluations show an up to linear scalability of SPECTRE with the number of CPU cores.

New York: Guildford Press.] cognitive model of social phobia proposes that following a social event, individuals with social phobia will engage in post-event processing, during which they conduct a detailed review of the event. This study investigated the relationship between self-appraisals of performance and post-event processing in individuals high and low in social anxiety. Participants appraised their performance immediately after a conversation with an unknown individual and prior to an anticipated second conversation task I week later. The frequency and valence of post-event processing during the week following the conversation was also assessed. The study also explored differences in the metacognitive processes of high and low socially anxious participants. The high socially anxious group experienced more anxiety, predicted worse performance, underestimated their actual performance, and engaged in more post-event processing than low socially anxious participants. The degree of negative post-event processing was linked to the extent of social anxiety and negative appraisals of performance, both immediately after the conversation task and I week later. Differences were also observed in some metacognitive processes. The results are discussed in relation to current theory and previous research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex event processing is key technology for current business in which sequences of events are controlled. However, defining complex events is not easy, and sequence learning algorithms can help. To that end, sequence learning methods should consider temporal relationship among events. In this paper, we tackle the problem of mining complex events using frequent sequence pattern mining with time gaps. A constraint model of the learning problem is proposed. Consistently, the learning problem is addressed using solvers off the shelf. The experiments are carried out in a bike hiring domain so as a CEP system can account how many users will reach a depot, independently of which was their origin. Results are analysed in terms of individual and multiple users, as well as regarding the scalability of the method.

DE Implicit concurrency; type-and-effect system
AB Implicit concurrency between handlers is important for event driven systems because it helps simultaneously promote modularity and scalability. Knowing the side-effect of the handlers is critical in these systems to avoid concurrency hazards such as data races. As event systems are dynamic because statically known and unknown handlers can register at almost any time during program execution, static effect analyses must reconcile over competing goals such as precision, soundness and modularity. We recently developed asynchronous, typed events, a system that can analyze the effects of the handlers at runtime. This mechanism utilizes runtime information to enable precise effect computation and greatly improves concurrency between handlers.
   In this paper, we present the formal underpinnings of asynchronous, typed events, and examine the concurrency safety properties it provides. The technical innovations of our system include a novel effect system to soundly approximate the dynamism introduced by runtime handlers registration, a static analysis to precompute the effects and a dynamic analysis that uses the precomputed effects to improve concurrency. Our design simplifies modular concurrency reasoning and avoids concurrency hazards.

AB Smart Forest is a concept derived from the Internet of Things (IoT) and defines sections of a forest where remote sensing is applied to collect data about environmental conditions. One of the main objectives of Smart Forests is to detect wild fire at early stages. However, the required technology for such monitoring usually demands a complex and expensive sensor and network infrastructure and requires central processing capabilities for analyzing data from several thousands of sensors. The goal of this work is to propose a solution focused on Edge Computing, using the concept of Mobile Hubs (M-Hubs). The developed Fire Detection IoT prototype application is based on the ContextNet middleware, and uses Event Processing Agents (EPAs), running on smart phones carried by forest guards. Scalability tests up to 10,000 remote sensors connected per M-Hub were performed.

AB This paper presents a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability in smart space applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). The architecture is built on top of a generic SPARQL endpoint where publishers and subscribers use standard SPARQL Updates and Queries. Notifications about events [i.e., changes in the resource description framework (RDF) knowledge base] are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification, limiting the network overhead and facilitating notification processing at subscriber side. A novel event detection algorithm, tailored on the IoT specificities (i.e., heterogeneous events need to be detected and continuous updates of few RDF triples dominate with respect to more complex updates), is presented along with the envisioned application design pattern and performance evaluation model. Eventually, a reference implementation is evaluated against a benchmark inspired by a smart city lighting case. The performance evaluation results show the capability to process up to 68k subscriptions/s triggered by simple single-lamp updates and up to 3.8k subscriptions/s triggered by more complex updates (i.e., 10 to 100 lamps).

DE Complex event processing; rule-based reasoning with uncertain
   information
AB There is a growing need for systems that react automatically to events. While some events are generated externally and deliver data across distributed systems, others need to be derived by the system itself based on available information. Event derivation is hampered by uncertainty attributed to causes such as unreliable data sources or the inability to determine with certainty whether an event has actually occurred, given available information. Two main challenges exist when designing a solution for event derivation under uncertainty. First, event derivation should scale under heavy loads of incoming events. Second, the associated probabilities must be correctly captured and represented. We present a solution to both problems by introducing a novel generic and formal mechanism and framework for managing event derivation under uncertainty. We also provide empirical evidence demonstrating the scalability and accuracy of our approach.

AB The rapid development of web service technology brings up a number of crucial requirements for designing service computing runtime, such as supporting multiple message exchange patterns, switching among different transports, integrating various extended web service protocols and achieving robust performance under high concurrency. Based on staged event-driven architecture, we propose a novel architecture for an adaptive web-service-centric service computing runtime, named SEDA4SC. In SEDA4SC, the process of basic and extended web service protocols is divided into four primary event-driven stages to enable system independence and module isolation. Moreover, this architecture allows messages to be handled in two independent pipelines: the input pipeline and the output pipeline. Arbitrary message exchange patterns can be supported through a combination of the two pipelines. With SEDA4SC, we design and implement a service computing runtime system. The performance evaluation results show that our system exhibits robust performance under high concurrency.

AB Many applications require the processing of event streams from different sources in combination with large amounts of background knowledge. Semantic CEP is a paradigm designed specifically for that. It extends complex event processing (CEP) with RDF support and uses a network of operators to process RDF streams in combination with RDF knowledge bases. Another popular class of systems designed for a similar purpose are the RDF stream processors (RSPs). These are systems that extend SPARQL (the RDF query language) with stream processing capabilities. Semantic CEP and RSPs have similar purposes but focus on different things. The former focuses on scalability and distributed processing while the latter tend to focus on the intricacies of RDF stream processing per se. In this paper we propose the use of RSP engines as building blocks for Semantic CEP. We present an infrastructure, called DSCEP, that allows the encapsulation of existing RSP engines into CEP-like operators so that these can be seamlessly interconnected in a distributed, decentralized operator network. DSCEP handles the hurdles of such interconnection, such as reliable communication, stream aggregation and slicing, event identification and time-stamping, etc., allowing users to concentrate on the queries. We also discuss in the paper how DSCEP can be used to speedup monolithic SPARQL queries by splitting them into parallel subqueries operating over restricted parts of the knowledge base.

AB This paper presents a dual-phase RC-based relaxation oscillator (RxO) with low temperature coefficient (TC) and high power efficiency achieved simultaneously for energyconstrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications with burstmode requirements. Its circuit-level event-driven architecture reduces the duty cycle of power-hungry blocks, saving power while posing little performance penalty. In addition, the charge reuse technique further reduces the power consumption for the always-on detecting circuit. Implemented in a 0.18- mu m CMOS process, the 180-kHz relaxation oscillator exhibits a frequency deviation of +/- 0.26% against temperature (-40 to 125 degrees C) from Monte-Carlo simulation (N=30), leading to a low temperature coefficient of 32 ppm/degrees C. The simulated power consumption is 163 nW, resulting in power efficiency of 0.9 nW/kHz.

The purpose of the platform is to derive useful information from diverse real-time sources such as collaborative processes. The platform provides technology where instant results are needed or where heterogeneous data must be integrated on the fly or where the data arrive fast enough to require the stream processing nature of our approach. The main advantages of the platforms are its scalability (cloud-based nature) and the expressivity of the event combinations that can be defined (using both real-time and historical data). The platform has been applied in a use case about Personal data management. In this paper we present some results from the validation, focusing on smartphone and social media integration.

AB The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN/Geneva is about to deliver first collision data to the CMS experiment. The CMS computing, software and analysis projects will need to meet the expected performances in terms of archiving of raw detector data, prompt calibration and primary reconstruction at the host laboratory, data distribution and handling at Tier-1 centres, data access and distributed physics analysis at Tier-2 centres. Hundreds of physicists located in nearly 200 institutions around the world will then expect to find the necessary infrastructure to easily access and process experimental data, including a large range of activities from low-level detector performance evaluation to involved discovery physics analysis. In the past two years, CMS has conducted computing, software, and analysis challenges to demonstrate the functionality, scalability, and usability of the computing and software components. These challenges have been designed to validate the CMS distributed computing model by demonstrating the functionality of many components simultaneously. We will present the major boost demonstrated by CMS in event processing, data transfers and analysis processing during the CSA07 and ongoing CCRC08 data challenges. In particular, we will describe relevant functional tests and the scale achieved from each CMS component and externally provided component. We will also summarize the main physics analysis lessons drawn from these challenges and the on-going tunings for an optimal begin of the experiment. We inform the reader that the present report contains updated results from the year 2008 in comparison with those presented during the conference.

AB Graph neural networks, which generalize deep learning to graph-structured data, have achieved significant improvements in numerous graph-related tasks. Petri nets (PNs), on the other hand, are mainly used for the modeling and analysis of various event-driven systems from the perspective of prior knowledge, mechanisms, and tasks. Compared with graph data, net data can simulate the dynamic behavioral features of systems and are more suitable for representing real-world problems. However, the problem of large-scale data analysis has been puzzling the PN field for decades, and thus, limited its universal applicability. In this article, a framework of net learning (NL) is proposed. NL contains the advantages of PN modeling and analysis with the advantages of graph learning computation. Then, two kinds of NL algorithms are designed for performance analysis of stochastic PNs, and more specifically, the hidden feature information of the PN is obtained by mapping net information to the low-dimensional feature space. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms on the performance analysis of stochastic PNs.

AB Audiovisual group communication systems deal with a large number of video streams, and, unlike less advanced videoconferencing systems, require intelligence for selecting adequate views for each of the connected rooms, in order to convey best what is happening in the other locations. Such a decision making component, in our implementation called Orchestration Engine (OE), acts as a Virtual Director. It processes low-level events, emitted by content analysis sensors, into editing commands. The OE has two main components: one that semantically lifts low-level events into communication events and one that associates editing decisions to communication contexts. The former has to deal with uncertain and delayed information. The latter subsumes knowledge that reflects both conversation and narrative principles. Both components include contradicting bodies of knowledge. We investigate a rule-based event processing approach and reflect the scalability of our solution regarding competing and contradicting rules.

DE Network Security; Situational Awareness; Architectural Model
AB Often network security technologies used by organizations for securing their computational systems are deficient in providing holistic view of the environment. Based on this, our paper presents an architectural model based on a Situational Awareness approach for securing computational systems in distributed environments. The architecture is called EXEHDA-ISSA and is inspired by SIEM systems. It is composed of three modular software components called Collector, SmartLogger, and Manager. These components are interconnected following a multi-level hierarchical model and provide features such as event collection, hybrid event processing and a hybrid approach to contextual data storage. For the purpose of evaluating this proposal, four case studies were developed to validate the holistic view of security events as well as the model's characteristics such as flexibility, autonomy, scalability and the support to heterogeneity. Finally, the strengths and limitations of our approach are discussed, then followed by future works.

TI TMS-RFID: Temporal management of large-scale RFID applications
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
DT Article
DE RFID data management; TTL; RFID event processing; Unordered event stream
AB In coming years, there will be billions of RFID tags living in the world tagging almost everything for tracking and identification purposes. This phenomenon will impose a new challenge not only to the network capacity but also to the scalability of event processing of RFID applications. Since most RFID applications are time sensitive, we propose a notion of Time To Live (TTL), representing the period of time that an RFID event can legally live in an RFID data management system, to manage various temporal event patterns. TTL is critical in the "Internet of Things" for handling a tremendous amount of partial event-tracking results. Also, TTL can be used to provide prompt responses to time-critical events so that the RFID data streams can be handled timely. We divide TTL into four categories according to the general event-handling patterns. Moreover, to extract event sequence from an unordered event stream correctly and handle TTL constrained event sequence effectively, we design a new data structure, namely Double Level Sequence Instance List (DLSIList), to record intermediate stages of event sequences. On the basis of this, an RFID data management system, namely Temporal Management System over RFID data streams (TMS-RFID), has been developed. This system can be constructed as a stand-alone middleware component to manage temporal event patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMS-RFID on extracting complex temporal event patterns through a detailed performance study using a range of high-speed data streams and various queries. The results show that TMS-RFID has a very high throughput, namely 170,000-870,000 events per second for different highly complex continuous queries. Moreover, the experiments also show that the main structure to record the intermediate stages in TMS-RFID does not increase exponentially with the number of events. These results demonstrate that TMSRFID not only supports high processing speeds, but is also highly scalable.

TI ACEP: an adaptive strategy for proactive and elastic processing of
   complex events
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
DT Article
DE Complex event processing; Parallelizing CEP operators; Auto-scalable;
   Horizontal Scaling; Self-adaptive load balancing; Data stream processing
AB The execution of complex event processing (CEP) applications on a set of clustered homogenous computing nodes is latency-sensitive, especially when workload conditions widely change at runtime. To manage the varying workloads of nodes in a scalable and cost-effective manner, adjusting the application parallelism at runtime is critical. To tackle the scalability challenge, we have extended an existing parallelization model called PARS that only supports stateless CEP operators and runs operators in parallel regions without changing the number of computing nodes assigned to parallel regions. We have added new features to PARS in support of stateful operators by introducing local controllers and new initiator and terminator event types, making partitioning fully transparent to application developers. We have proved the correctness of this extended model, called PARS+ , with respect to its presented formal definition. We have then used PARS+ as the base parallelization model in formulation of an adaptive strategy called ACEP to auto-scale operators including the stateful operators. Scaling decisions are governed by a predictive performance model that uses a control-theoretic method for estimating the resource and latency costs of each operator at runtime. The loads of clustered compute nodes are monitored, and compute nodes in a parallel region are reconfigured at runtime to ensure a balanced load on all compute nodes, accruing minimum cost to parallelize a stateful operator. ACEP minimizes network delays because it does not force using the shared state or techniques that employ state migration. We have built an event generator to simulate event sources and experimentally evaluate the ACEP strategy in terms of response time and resource costs. Two variant implementations of ACEP have been compared with the elastic strategy presented by Xiao et al. (2018), and the findings demonstrated that our implementations had adapted themselves better in different resource and response-time-sensitive scenarios, with lower response time (6%) and lower resource cost (8%).

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a technology of choice for high performance event analytics in time-critical decision making applications. Yet it is becoming increasingly difficult to support high-performance event processing due to the rising number and complexity of event pattern queries and the increasingly high velocity of event streams. In this work we design the SPASS framework that successfully tackles these demanding CEP workloads. Our SPASS optimizer identifies opportunities for effective shared processing among CEP queries by leveraging time-based event correlations among queries. The problem of pattern sharing is shown to he NP-hard by reducing the Minimum Substring Cover problem to our CEP pattern sharing problem. The SPASS optimizer is designed that finds a shared pattern plan in polynomial-time covering all sequence patterns while still guaranteeing an optimality bound. To execute this shared pattern plan, the SPASS runtime employs stream transactions that assure concurrent shared maintenance and re-use of sub-patterns across queries. Our experimental study confirms that the SPASS framework achieves over 16 fold performance improvement for a wide range of experiments compared to the state-of-the-art solution.

AB Equipment failures in manufacturing processes concern industries because they can lead to severe issues regarding human safety, environmental impact, reliability, and production costs. The stochastic nature of equipment degradation and the uncertainty about future breakdowns affect significantly the maintenance and inventory decisions. Proactive event processing can facilitate this decision-making process in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, but real-time data processing poses several challenges in efficiency and scalability of the associated information systems. Therefore, appropriate real-time, eventdriven algorithms and models are required for deciding on the basis of predictions, ahead of time. We propose a proactive event-driven model for joint maintenance and logistics optimization in a sensor-based, data-rich industrial environment. The proposed model is able to be embedded in a real-time, event-driven information system in order to be triggered by prediction events about the future equipment health state. Moreover, the proposed model handles multiple alternative (imperfect and perfect) maintenance actions and associated spare parts orders and facilitates proactive decision making in the context of Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM). The proposed proactive decision model was validated in real industrial environment and was further evaluated with a comparative and a sensitivity analysis.

AB Internet applications require high-performance network server architecture. This paper proposes a kind of software architecture for network server, AEANS, which aims at supporting Internet applications. By introducing a new thread abstraction, micro-thread, MEANS upwardly provides the micro-thread environment to programmers, and downwardly accesses the OS services concurrently through traditional thread primitives, and uses the event-driven mechanism to manage and schedule micro-threads, which takes advantage of both multithread and event-driven architecture. Moreover, MEANS is general, scalable, robust and adaptable. By preliminary evaluation, in terms of the concurrence policy, MEANS has features similar to event-driven architecture; and it outperforms multithread architecture in I/Oaccessing.

AB Moving object monitoring is becoming essential for companies and organizations that need to manage thousands or even millions of commercial vehicles or vessels, detect dangerous situations (e.g., collisions or malfunctions) and optimize their behavior. It is a task that must be executed in real-time, reporting any such situations or opportunities as soon as they appear. Given the growing sizes of fleets worldwide, a monitoring system must be highly efficient and scalable. It is becoming an increasingly common requirement that such monitoring systems should be able to automatically detect complex situations, possibly involving multiple moving objects and requiring extensive background knowledge. Building a monitoring system that is both expressive and scalable is a significant challenge. Typically, the more expressive a system is, the less flexible it becomes in terms of its parallelization potential. We present a system that strikes a balance between expressiveness and scalability. Going beyond event detection, we also present an approach towards event forecasting. We show how event patterns may be given a probabilistic description so that our system can forecast when a complex event is expected to occur. Our proposed system employs a formalism that allows analysts to define complex patterns in a user-friendly manner while maintaining unambiguous semantics and avoiding ad hoc constructs. At the same time, depending on the problem at hand, it can employ different parallelization strategies in order to address the issue of scalability. It can also employ different training strategies in order to fine-tune the probabilistic models constructed for event forecasting. Our experimental results show that our system can detect complex patterns over moving entities with minimal latency, even when the load on our system surpasses what is to be realistically expected in real-world scenarios.

AB Socially anxious individuals tend to review past distressing social situations, a process called post-event pro-cessing. The goal of this 4-day study was to investigate how PEP evolved over time in between two speech tasks in a sample of 101 students using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In addition, we examined the re-lationships between post-event processing and other cognitive and affective processes involved in social anxiety, including anticipatory processing, anxiety, performance appraisals, and memory. Results from EMA showed that post-event and anticipatory processing decreased over time. Higher anxiety during the speech and poorer per-formance appraisals predicted more post-event processing, though post-event processing was unrelated to changes in performance appraisals over time. Post-event processing the day following the first speech was positively associated with anticipatory processing the day before the second speech. Participants who engaged in more post-event processing also remembered the first speech differently (e.g., more negative and emotionally intense). Implications for the cognitive-behavioural treatment of social anxiety are discussed.

AB In the aftermath of a distressing social event, adults with social phobia (SP) engage in a review of this event with a focus on its negative aspects. To date, little is known about this post-event processing (PEP) and its relationship with perceived performance in SP children. We measured PEP in SP children (n = 24) and healthy controls (HC; n = 22), aged from 8 to 12 years, after the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C). Children also rated their performance immediately after the TSST-C and 2.5 h later. SP children reported more negative and less positive PEP than controls. Regression analyses indicated that negative PEP was associated with social anxiety and perceived task performance independent of comorbid depression. The SP group rated their performance immediately after the TSST-C as worse compared to HCs and ratings remained stable over the following 2.5 h. Results are discussed in relation to current theories of SP.

TI Framework for a Cloud-Based Multimedia Surveillance System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
DT Article
AB The new generation of multimedia surveillance systems integrates a large number of heterogeneous sensors to collect, process, and analyze multimedia data for identifying events of potential security threats. Some of the major concerns facing these systems are scalability, ubiquitous access to sensory data, event processing overhead, and massive storage requirements-all of which demand novel scalable approach. Cloud computing can provide a powerful and scalable infrastructure for large-scale storage, processing, and dissemination of sensor data. Furthermore, the integration of sensor technology and cloud computing offers new possibilities for efficient development and deployment of sensor-based systems. This paper proposes a framework for a cloud-based multimedia surveillance system and highlights several research and technical issues. A prototype surveillance system is also designed and analyzed in the context of the proposed surveillance framework. The paper finally reports that cloud-based multimedia surveillance system can effectively support the processing overload, storage requirements, ubiquitous access, security, and privacy in large-scale surveillance settings.

AB Sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems are important in the context of "Intelligent Infrastructures". In this scenario, healthcare is one area where sensors and mobile platforms will become more useful and the application must have the capability of analysing the data feeds from sensors to extract useful meanings. Various data analytics methods such as data-mining techniques or stream processing and continuous event processing techniques are useful in this regard. This paper is a broad survey article where we look into the emerging trends in Ubiquitous Healthcare Information Systems focussing on the use of analytics techniques to cluster patients into similar groups, or to process streaming data for detecting abnormal medical conditions as early as possible. Considering the size of the population and hence the volume of data, there are several architectural challenges such as scalability and availability of the platforms and support for "big-data" handling. We try to summarise how these problems have been addressed and whether the solutions are adequate or not.

AB Despite suffering from inefficiency and flexibility limitations, the filter-based routing (FBR) algorithm is widely used in content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems. To address its limitations, we propose a dynamic destination-based routing algorithm called D-DBR, which decomposes pub/sub into two independent parts: Content-based matching and destination-based multicasting. D-DBR exhibits low event matching cost and high efficiency, flexibility, and robustness for event routing in small scale overlays. To boost scalability, we further complement D-DBR with a new routing algorithm called MERC. ME RC divides the overlay into interconnected clusters and applies content-based and destination based mechanisms to route events inter- and intra-cluster, respectively. We implemented all algorithms in the PADRES pub/sub system. Experimental results show that our algorithms outperform FBR in terms of improving event dissemination throughput by up to 700% and reducing the end-to end latency by up to 55%.

TI A Multidomain Standards-Based Fog Computing Architecture for Smart
   Cities
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
DT Article
AB Many of the problems arising from rapid urbanization and urban population growth can be solved by making cities "smart". These smart cities are supported by large networks of interconnected and widely geo-distributed devices, known as Internet of Things or IoT, that generate large volumes of data. Traditionally, cloud computing has been the technology used to support this infrastructure; however, some of the essential requirements of smart cities such as low-latency, mobility support, location-awareness, bandwidth cost savings, and geo-distributed nature of such IoT systems cannot be met. To solve these problems, the fog computing paradigm proposes extending cloud computing models to the edge of the network. However, most of the proposed architectures and frameworks are based on their own private data models and interfaces, which severely reduce the openness and interoperability of these solutions. To address this problem, we propose a standard-based fog computing architecture to enable it to be an open and interoperable solution. The proposed architecture moves the stream processing tasks to the edge of the network through the use of lightweight context brokers and Complex Event Processing (CEP) to reduce latency. Moreover, to communicate the different smart cities domains we propose a Context Broker based on a publish/subscribe middleware specially designed to be elastic and low-latency and exploit the context information of these environments. Additionally, we validate our architecture through a real smart city use case, showing how the proposed architecture can successfully meet the smart cities requirements by taking advantage of the fog computing approach. Finally, we also analyze the performance of the proposed Context Broker based on microbenchmarking results for latency, throughput, and scalability.

AB Many existing object-oriented languages and new language proposals include threads to achieve high performance on modern SMPs. This paper presents Active Threads an extensible and portable high-performance thread system that addresses the runtime needs of OO languages. An event driven architecture capable of supporting different scheduling policies is presented. Thread scheduling that exploits the temporal and spatial locality is considered in detail. Active Threads is ported by retargeting the eight primitives of the Portability interface. The system currently runs on several hardware platforms including SPARC, Intel i386 and higher DEC Alpha AXP HPPA and outperforms vendor thread packages as much as by orders of magnitude. Active Threads is used as a compilation target for Sather; a parallel object-oriented language developed at ICSI. Active Threads is also used by a threaded distributed extension of C++.

AB Timely insight into manufacturing processes events can help in improving its efficiency and agility. Events are state change in process execution that can be not only monitored but correlated and managed in order to take immediate action. In this paper a new approach to develop event driven manufacturing process management solutions is presented. The event-driven architecture is considered as the basis to design a unified modeling methodology which enables near real time event stream processing. The approach adapts Business Process Management to manufacturing at the different automation levels (ISA-95 levels 2, 3 and 4). The key issue is to model the logic of complex events in manufacturing processes. The use of BPMN 2.0 is proposed as the standardized modeling language. Through this notation a standardized definition of business logic for monitoring and controlling manufacturing operations can be developed, representing the knowledge to apply in order to increase process performance.

AB IoT-based systems for early epidemic detection have not been investigated yet in the research. The state-of-the art in sensor technology and activity recognition makes it possible to automatically detect activities of daily living (ADL). Semantic reasoning over ADLs can discover anomalies and symptoms for disorders, hence diseases and epidemics. However, semantic reasoning is computationally rather expensive and therefore unusable for real-time monitoring in large scale applications, like early epidemic detection. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a new scalable semantic framework based on several semantic reasoning techniques that are distributed over a semantic middleware. To reduce the number of events to process during the semantic reasoning, a complex event processing (CEP) engine is used to detect abnormal events in ADL and to generate the associated symptom indicators. To demonstrate real-time detection and scalability, the proposed framework integrates a new extension of ADLSim, a discrete event simulator that simulates long-term sequences of ADL.

AB There is a growing demand for web applications to provide fair service to the highly concurrent requests. In this paper, we present an approach to addressing this requirement. Based on the Staged Event-Driven Architecture (SEDA), our design takes advantage of global control strategy to balance the loadings across the staged network, makes use of system identification to automatically model performance, and applies control theory to automatically control performance fairness. By implementing our design on a web server and evaluating the performance with unpredictable dynamic loadings, we demonstrate that our design is able to yield superior performance on fairness, showing high accuracy and good robustness.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) has become the key part of Internet of Things (IoT). Proactive CEP can predict future system states and execute some actions to avoid unwanted states which brings new hope to transportation IoT. In this paper, we propose a proactive CEP architecture and method for transportation IoT. Based on basic CEP technology, this method uses structure varying Bayesian network to predict future events and system states. Different Bayesian network structures are learned and used according to different event context. A networked distributed Markov decision processes model with predicting states is proposed as sequential decision model. Q-learning method is investigated for this model to find optimal joint policy. The experimental evaluations show that this method works well when used to control congestion in transportation IoT.

AB The sense of touch enables us to safely interact and control our contacts with our surroundings. Many technical systems and applications could profit from a similar type of sense. Yet, despite the emergence of e-skin systems covering more extensive areas, large-area realizations of e-skin effectively boosting applications are still rare. Recent advancements have improved the deployability and robustness of e-skin systems laying the basis for their scalability. However, the upscaling of e-skin systems introduces yet another challenge-the challenge of handling a large amount of heterogeneous tactile information with complex spatial relations between sensing points. We targeted this challenge and proposed an event-driven approach for large-area skin systems. While our previous works focused on the implementation and the experimental validation of the approach, this work now provides the consolidated foundations for realizing, designing, and understanding large-area event-driven e-skin systems for effective applications. This work homogenizes the different perspectives on event-driven systems and assesses the applicability of existing event-driven implementations in large-area skin systems. Additionally, we provide novel guidelines for tuning the novelty-threshold of event generators. Overall, this work develops a systematic approach towards realizing a flexible event-driven information handling system on standard computer systems for large-scale e-skin with detailed descriptions on the effective design of event generators and decoders. All designs and guidelines are validated by outlining their impacts on our implementations, and by consolidating various experimental results. The resulting system design for e-skin systems is scalable, efficient, flexible, and capable of handling large amounts of information without customized hardware. The system provides the feasibility of complex large-area tactile applications, for instance in robotics.

AB As a large amount of stream data are generated through sensors over the Internet of Things environment, studies on complex event processing have been conducted to detect information required by users or specific applications in real time. A complex event is made by combining primitive events through a number of operators. However, the existing complex event-processing methods take a long time because they do not consider similarity and redundancy of operators. In this paper, we propose a new complex event-processing method considering similar and redundant operations for stream data from sensors in real time. In the proposed method, a similar operation in common events is converted into a virtual operator, and redundant operations on the same events are converted into a single operator. The event query tree for complex event detection is reconstructed using the converted operators. Through this method, the cost of comparison and inspection of similar and redundant operations is reduced, thereby decreasing the overall processing cost. To prove the superior performance of the proposed method, its performance is evaluated in comparison with existing methods.

AB With the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors, complex event proceesing (CEP) is becoming increasingly important to scalably detect situations in real time. Current CEP systems are not capable of dealing efficiently with highly dynamic mobile consumers whose interests change with their location. We introduce the distributed mobile CEP (MCEP) system which automatically adapts the processing of events according to a consumer's location. MCEP significantly reduces latency, network utilization, and processing overhead by providing on-demand and opportunistic adaptation algorithms to dynamically assign event streams and computing resources to operators of the MCEP system.

AB Nowadays, in many recent applications; the data size become too large to be managed within the limited storage environments. In such applications, the data is a streaming data and has a continuously flowing data format. Queries on streaming data are performed using declarative queries, as opposed to queries made on classical databases. Declarative queries provide the ability to filter on a continuous data stream. In addition, they provide the ability to follow the data that match the conditions in the queries. Systems with a data structure in a continuous data flow format can be considered Event-based Systems, in which unit data can be considered as a real event. In such systems; real-time detection of complex events that will trigger business processes is becoming an important need. Within the scope of this research, a Complex Event Monitoring Infrastructure is proposed to address this deficiency. The proposed infrastructure provides the detection of complex events, which form the preconditions for initiating business processes in Event-based Systems. In order to demonstrate the usability of the proposed infrastructure, a prototype application has been developed for e-commerce web sites, where the click-stream data is generated in a streaming data format. Prototype application continuously monitors customer click-stream data collected from the Web site, where the trade takes place (e-commerce environment). Each click-stream data, labeled with a timestamp, is considered as an event data. By combining the basic events, occurring within a certain time period, complex events are identified and the appropriate business processes for corresponding commercial activities are triggered. The developed application was evaluated from the perspective of performance and scalability, and positive results were obtained indicating the usability of the proposed infrastructure.

AB This work paper presents a single-channel Kanban solution where ticketing from downstream operator to the upstream operator in production flow is automatically performed when the completion of operations is identified. Thus, a more efficient transmission and placement mechanism for the tickets is provided for real-time operation of the machines, compared with others Kanban solutions. Our proposed solution contains elements of modern interdisciplinary research: industrial process improvement solutions using one Just in Time methodology: Kanban system, self -harvesting sensors, non-invasive monitoring solutions, multiple-source acquisition software, complex event processing and real-time parallel processing, use of Machine Learning analysis techniques (Deep Learning networks) to identify equipment operating regimes, use of ad hoc radio networks for data communication. The system was developed at an experimental model level. The article presents, with results, a case study in which we have two operators in a production stream. As will be shown, the system has a high degree of scalability, so it can easily be extended to any number of operators in the production stream.

AB Climate changes and the ongoing intensification of agriculture effect in increased material inputs in watercourses and dams. To ensure an efficient and environmentally friendly water resource management, water management associations need means for efficient water monitoring as well as novel strategies to reduce the pollution of surface and ground water. Traditionally, water management associations operate large sensor networks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement data to monitor and model physical processes within the catchments they are responsible for. Implementing a comprehensive monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ data. Due to the evolvement of the Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader availability of satellite data provides a great potential for deriving valuable, complementary information from Earth Observation data, that contributes to a detailed understanding of hydrological processes. Although the number of satellite data platforms that provide online processing environments is growing, it is still a big challenge to integrate those platforms into traditional workflows of users from environmental domains such as hydrology. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the generation of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology. The presented WaCoDiS System comprises several microservices as well standardized interfaces that enable a platform-independent processing of satellite data. First, we discuss the contribution of Earth Observation data to water monitoring and derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of satellite data processing. We then describe our system design with a brief overview about the different system components which form an automated processing pipeline. The suitability of our system is proven as part of a pre-operational deployment for a German water management association. In addition, we demonstrate how our system is capable of integrating satellite data platforms, using the Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform -Deutschland (CODE-DE) as a reference example.

AB Context The IoT network is comprised of numerous and heterogeneous devices that are capable of generating large amounts of events. To enable the IoT paradigm, it is necessary to integrate, process, and react to events on the fly.
   Objective: The goal of this paper is to support the increased demands of scalability, flexibility, autonomy, and heterogeneity for IoT event processing. A distributed architectural model based on Situational Awareness, named EXEHDA-SA, was designed to provide event collection, hybrid processing, and customizable and dynamic reaction features.
   Method The conception of the model was based on a middleware for ubiquitous computing called EXEHDA, thus benefiting from its already defined strategies. The proposal follows a multi-level strategy and consists of three hierarchically interconnected modular components.
   Results: Our main contribution is the conception and validation of a model for event collection, processing and reaction for modern distributed environments. The contribution is evidenced through experiments performed on a prototype implemented on consolidated free and open source technologies. The experiments are made up of five case studies where each one evaluates a scenario for IoT demands.
   Conclusion: Through these case studies which were proposed in information security area, we demonstrated the feasibility of this proposal for deployment in IoT production environments. Furthermore, EXEHDA-SA is able to operate on different scenarios due to each component modularity and its consequent extensibility.

AB WS-BPEL (BPEL for short) represents the de-factor standard for the Web set-vices composition. Service Orchestration engines, also named BPEL engines, are in charge Of executing and managing the workflow specified ill BPEL. As a kind of server application, high performance under massive concurrency is necessary to design a scalable BPEL engine, and it is a challenging problem to implement it correct and highly concurrent BPEL engine. We propose all approach based oil event-driven architecture to design BPEL engine and introduce the FSM (finite state machines) to describe the semantics of the BPEL process. We also test our BPEL engine and prove the improvement in capability of handling the massive concurrency comparing to the one based on the thread-based concurrent paradigm.

AB In this paper, we propose a new linkage method for the great amount of event data in distributed computing environments. This method is used for event-data processing such as System Behavior Visualization, which can diagnose and provide information about complex distributed IT system behavior. The event data using System Behavior Visualization are network messages between IT system servers. In this method, we use two techniques: probe and data distribution by "source". The probe is a useful post-processing tool when event data have come fast and finding the link-able event data has been difficult due to limited time. For the probe method, the counts of probe communication are very important for scalability. In our method, event data are allocated based on their "source" information because this reduces the counts of probe communication. We evaluate our method from the view-points of the throughput related with the load and the number of event processing servers. By using this method, the event-data processing can perform highly in the distributed computing environment. Experimental data demonstrated the viability of our propose method.

AB State changes over time are inherent characteristics of stateful applications. So far, there are almost no attempts to make the past application history programmatically accessible or even modifiable. This is primarily due to the complexity of temporal changes and a difficult alignment with prevalent programming primitives and persistence strategies. Retroactive computing enables powerful capabilities though, including computations and predictions of alternate application timelines, post-hoc bug fixes, or retroactive state explorations. We propose an event-driven programming model that is oriented towards serverless computing and applies retroaction to the event sourcing paradigm. Our model is deliberately restrictive, but therefore keeps the complexity of retroactive operations in check. We introduce RETRO-lambda, a runtime platform that implements the model and provides retroactive capabilites to its applications. While RETRO-lambda only shows negligible performance overheads compared to similar solutions for running regular applications, it enables its users to execute retroactive computations on the application histories as part of its programming model.

AB In this paper, the effect of communication networks to the distributed simulation has been studied. A cellular network application is simulated on a network of workstations, where an ordinary 10 Mbps. Ethernet LAN has been used as the communication network. The effect of distribution is analysed by using the well known concept of critical path analysis, which requires event traces from real simulations and information about event processing times as well as about their mutual relationships. In order to capture the effect of conservative synchronization, the event traces are collected from parallel simulations instead of sequential. By using event traces and execution times, critical paths are calculated for different numbers of workstations. The use of different configurations reveals the effect of distribution, as well as the scalability of the problem in the distributed environment. The critical path analysis reveals that the cellular network application is quite suitable for distributed simulation when conservative synchronization is used. Good approximations for the execution time can be achieved if the problem is suitably partitioned into different workstations.

AB High frequency trading is steadily taking over the equity trading world. High frequency trading involves very high speed systems placing trades at sub millisecond speeds across multiple stock exchanges. HFT is a good example for Big Data analytics - especially the velocity aspect of big data. For HFT strategies to be profitable, real time processing of big data is essential. In this paper we discuss the challenges faced by HFT systems and the opportunity for big data processing with low latency in the field. Most HFT systems are designed using real time stream processing, which have certain drawbacks. We present a theoretical framework for building high frequency trading systems using the complex event processing paradigm which could overcome the drawbacks of stream processing. Complex event processing enables detecting patterns of events from disparate events streams and responds to the detected pattern. The applicability of the framework for HFT applications is discussed.

AB With rapid expansion of wireless ad hoc networks and their interactions with wired networks together with the use of location-based services and the deployment of mobile and wearable sensor devices, it is now possible to develop context aware applications such as those in healthcare and transportation. These applications could react to the environment changes and users' preference with the main aim is to make their life more comfortable according to their locations, current time and situations. However, handling context changes according to current data and events is a difficult task without supporting tools. Therefore, a platform that includes real-time event/data acquisition and processing is required. In this paper, we first survey existing work related to event processing and big data technologies by highlighting current challenges related to real-time data processing. We then introduce a context-aware platform that merges different technologies such as service oriented architecture, complex-event processing (CEP) tools, and big data technologies. A sample context-aware application for energy efficient buildings control is presented to highlight the different components of the platform and their interactions.

AB Complex event processing has been widely adopted in different domains, from large-scale sensor networks, smart home, transportation, to industrial monitoring, providing the ability of intelligent procession and decision making supporting. In many application scenarios, a lot of complex events are long-term, which takes a long time to happen. Processing long-term complex event with traditional approaches usually leads to the increase of runtime states and therefore impact the processing performance. Hence, it requires an efficient long-term event processing approach and intermediate results storage/query policy to solve this type of problems. In this paper, we propose an event processing system, LTCEP, for long-term event. In LTCEP, we leverage the semantic constraints calculus to split a long-term event into two parts, online detection and event buffering respectively. A long-term query mechanism and event buffering structure are established to optimize the fast response ability and processing performance. Experiments prove that, for long-term event processing, LTCEP model can effectively reduce the redundant runtime state, which provides a higher response performance and system throughput comparing to other selected benchmarks.

AB This paper designs a rule-based complex event processing platform that processes rules for processing sensor data streams differently depending on the front, hack, and sides of the naval vessel. The complex event processing platform supports event filtering rules, event capturing rules, continuous queries rules, and complex event processing rules. To support the high-performance rule-based complex event processing, our platform implements continuous query indexing, CEP index, and Rete algorithm.

AB Today the LHC offline computing relies heavily on CPU resources, despite the interest in compute accelerators, such as GPUs, for the longer term future. The number of cores per CPU socket has continued to increase steadily, reaching the levels of 64 cores (128 threads) with recent AMD EPYC processors, and 128 cores on Ampere Altra Max ARM processors. Over the course of the past decade, the CMS data processing framework, CMSSW, has been transformed from a single-threaded framework into a highly concurrent one. The first multithreaded version was brought into production by the start of the LHC Run 2 in 2015. Since then, the framework's threading efficiency has gradually been improved by adding more levels of concurrency and reducing the amount of serial code paths. The latest addition was support for concurrent Runs. In this work we review the concurrency model of the CMSSW, and measure its scalability with real CMS applications, such as simulation and reconstruction, on modern many-core machines. We show metrics such as event processing throughput and application memory usage with and without the contribution of I/O, as I/O has been the major scaling limitation for the CMS applications.

AB The modeling and simulation of social networks is an important approach to better understanding complex social phenomena, especially when the inner structure has remarkable impact on behavior. With the availability of unprecedented data sets, simulating large-scale social networks of millions, or even billions, of entities has become a new challenge. Current simulation environments for social studies are mostly sequential and may not be efficient when social networks grow to a certain size. In order to facilitate large-scale social network modeling and simulation, this paper proposes a framework named SUPE-Net, which is based on a parallel discrete event simulation environment YH-SUPE for massively parallel architectures. The framework is designed as a layered architecture with utilities for network generation, algorithms and agent-based modeling. Distributed adjacency lists are used for graph modeling and a reaction-diffusion paradigm is adapted to model dynamical processes. Experiments are performed using PageRank and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on social networks with millions of entities. The results demonstrate that SUPE-Net has achieved a speedup of 12, and increased the event-processing rate by 11%, with good scalability and effectiveness.

AB The QuickSilver Event Processing Module (EPM), an electronics module used in Siemens Inveon PET and SPECT systems, provides data acquisition, event processing and coincidence determination functions. Custom mixed-signal CMOS ASICs and high speed ADCs are utilized to provide the front-end analog portion of the data acquisition. A high performance FPGA provides the digital portion of the data acquisition running at 100 MHz, the subsequent event processing, and the coincidence determination. The high performance FPGA also provides multiple high speed serial data channels for external interconnection. This interconnection allows the module to be replicated as needed in a distributed parallel processing architecture to provide flexible, high performance, PET and SPECT imaging. The module also provides controllable high voltage needed to bias detectors. A 64 channel, LSO based PET system built using 16 EPMs yielded 1.22 ns FWHM system timing and better than 14% energy resolution.

TI Scalable Software Defined Network Controllers
SO ACM SIGCOMM COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW
DT Article
DE Software-defined Networking; Haskell; OpenFlow; Multicore
AB Software defined networking (SDN) introduces centralized controllers to dramatically increase network programmability. The simplicity of a logical centralized controller, however, can come at the cost of control-plane scalability. In this demo, we present McNettle, an extensible SDN control system whose control event processing throughput scales with the number of system CPU cores and which supports control algorithms requiring globally visible state changes occurring at flow arrival rates. Programmers extend McNettle by writing event handlers and background programs in a high-level functional programming language extended with shared state and memory transactions. We implement our framework in Haskell and leverage the multicore facilities of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and runtime system. Our implementation schedules event handlers, allocates memory, optimizes message parsing and serialization, and reduces system calls in order to optimize cache usage, OS processing, and runtime system overhead. Our experiments show that McNettle can serve up to 5000 switches using a single controller with 46 cores, achieving throughput of over 14 million flows per second, near-linear scaling up to 46 cores, and latency under 200 mu s for light loads and 10 ms with loads consisting of up to 5000 switches.

AB Real-time distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems are increasingly using complex event processing to make inferences about the environment. This mode of operation is able to reduce communication requirements, improve robustness and scalability, and avoid the need for big data storage and processing. With systems making many inferences about the environment, there is no provision for general access to these inferences as well as the ability to make further inferences. Most IoT systems are closed or very limited in their openness and discoverability because they are exist for commercial purposes in which they control all the elements of the system. To this end, we propose the concept of an Open Inference Network (OIN): a novel open architecture for detecting and publishing complex events at various abstraction levels in an event cloud, i.e. the set of events consumed and produced by this system. Such systems contain three types of nodes: basic event source, inference, and activity nodes. Inference nodes detect event patterns that may encode some meaning and inject corresponding higher-level events into the event cloud. Activity nodes respond to an event by prompting an external system to perform some action; such an action may result in outputs that appear as new events. We consider the architecture requirements for OIN by assessing the required architectural elements against current IoT standards. These requirements mainly consist of event description and discoverability, and security, which together enable developers to collaboratively grow and evolve OINs. This is an intermediate study which does not include an empirical study.

AB Pattern queries are widely used in complex event processing (CEP) systems. Existing pattern matching techniques, however, can provide only limited performance for expensive queries in real-world applications, which may involve Kleene closure patterns, flexible event selection strategies, and events with imprecise timestamps. To support these expensive queries with high performance, we begin our study by analyzing the complexity of pattern queries, with a focus on the fundamental understanding of which features make pattern queries more expressive and at the same time more computationally expensive. This analysis allows us to identify performance bottlenecks in processing those expensive queries, and provides key insights for us to develop a series of optimizations to mitigate those bottlenecks. Microbench-mark results show superior performance of our system for expensive pattern queries while most state-of-the-art systems suffer from poor performance. A thorough case study on Hadoop cluster monitoring further demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed techniques.

AB Processing-intensive web server requests can lead to low Quality of Service (QoS), such as longer mean response time and lower throughput, which calls for a new web server software framework that can improve the performance of web servers. The characteristic of request-level parallelism in web servers is fit for many-core architecture accelerators, such as GPU and Intel Xeon Phi co-processors, but traditional web server model cannot make full use of the performance of these accelerators. We proposed a new web server software framework- called MIC-based Server-side Accelerator Framework (MSAF)-for a machine with not only multi-core CPUs but also Intel Xeon Phi co-processors based on Staged Event Driven Architecture (SEDA). The framework can fully exploit the performance of Intel Xeon Phi co-processors and multi-core CPUs, and improve power/energy efficiency by offloading the stage of handling requests to Intel Xeon Phi co-processors. We implemented the web server simulation software based on MSAF framework on a machine with multi-core CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processors, and evaluated it by means of Apache Benchmark (AB). Our evaluation of MSAF shows its performance is about equivalent to that of a web server cluster consisting of four to five computing nodes. This paper indicates that if MSAF is applied to, Intel Xeon Phi co-processors are suitable for server side software, such as web servers, DNS servers, and database servers, because of its characteristic of lower communication latency between Intel Xeon Phi co-processors and host, more powerful logic processing ability, and more energy efficiency.

AB Cyber-physical systems integrate physical and cyber components for high performance, self-maintenance, self organization, self-assembly, while the process must be dependable, safety, securely, efficiently and in real-time. The research challenges of cyber-physical system are concerning: abstractions and architecture; distributed computation and networked control; verification and validation. This paper aims to meet the development of the cyber-physical systems, especially the ones referring to dependability, by the development of a method for system behaviour evaluation with two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative evaluation is made using a multi-agent model that supports an event-driven architecture. The most appropriate methodology - INGENIAS approach - for event-driven multi-agent model development, is selected based on more evaluation criteria. The paper presents the analysis to-design procedure of the model consisting in the description of the following meta-models: organization, environment, agent, tasks/goals, and interaction.

AB Events on the Web are increasingly being produced in the form of data streams, and are present in many different scenarios and applications such as health monitoring, environmental sensing or social networks. The heterogeneity of event streams has raised the challenges of integrating, interpreting and processing them coherently. Semantic technologies have shown to provide both a formal and practical framework to address some of these challenges, producing standards for representation and querying, such as RDF and SPARQL. However, these standards are not suitable for dealing with streams for events, as they do not include the concpets of streaming and continuous processing. The idea of RDF stream processing (RSP) has emerged in recent years to fill this gap, and the research community has produced prototype engines that cover aspects including complex event processing and stream reasoning to varying degrees. However, these existing prototypes often overlook key principles of reactive systems, regarding the event-driven processing, responsiveness, resiliency and scalability. In this paper we present a reactive model for implementing RSP systems, based on the Actor model, which relies on asynchronous message passing of events. Furthermore, we study the responsiveness property of RSP systems, in particular for the delivery of streaming results.

ID PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
AB Today event-driven business process management has matured from a scientific vision to a realizable methodology for companies of all sizes and shapes. However, leveraging the power of complex event processing for supporting business process monitoring is cumbersome because of the complicated modeling of rules and alerts as well as key performance indicators in machine readable format using the event languages. However, using a model-driven approach for generating a monitoring infrastructure based on events like the aPro architecture is one possibility to enable companies with various infrastructures to leverage the advantages of business process monitoring. This paper describes how KPIs are modeled and transferred into event rules by a model-driven approach.

AB EventScript is a simple but powerful language for programming reactive processes. A stream of incoming events is matched against a regular expression. Actions embedded within the regular expression are executed in response to the matching of patterns of events. These actions include assigning computed values to variables and emitting output events. The definition of EventScript presented a number of novel and interesting language-design choices. EventScript has an efficient implementation, and has been used in a development environment for complex event-based applications. We have used EventScript to program both small examples and large industrial applications. Readers of EventScript programs find them easy to understand, and are comfortable with the familiar model of matching regular expressions.

AB The present study examined the relationship between perceptions of performance and post-event processing (PEP) following task feedback in individuals with social phobia and matched control participants. Groups of high and low socially anxious participants engaged in a structured 5-min conversation in groups of four people. Following the conversation, false feedback (given in the form of either high scores or moderate scores) was given and self-appraisals of performance, levels of positive and negative mood, and levels of PEP were assessed. Results showed that participants' perceptions of their own performance and levels of positive affect significantly predicted the degree to which they engaged in negative rumination about the task. The moderate score condition was found to be detrimental for socially anxious individuals' self-appraisals and PEP, whereas controls showed no significant difference in self-appraisal and PEP, regardless of feedback. The results are discussed in relation to current cognitive models of social phobia and both treatment implications and directions for future research are explored. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ID POLICY
AB Event-based system (EBS) has become popular because of its high flexibility, scalability, and adaptability. These advantages are enabled by its communication mechanism-implicit invocation and implicit concurrency between components. The communication mechanism is based on non-determinism in event processing, which can introduce inherent security vulnerabilities into a system referred to as event attacks. Event attack is a particular type of attack that can abuse, incapacitate, and damage a target system by exploiting the system's event-based communication model. It is hard to prevent event attacks because they are administered in a way that does not differ from ordinary event-based communication in general. While a number of techniques have focused on security threats in EBS, they do not appropriately resolve the event attack issues or suffer from inaccuracy in detecting and preventing event attacks. To address the risk of event attacks, I present a novel vulnerability detection technique for EBSs that are implemented by using message-oriented middleware platform. My technique has been evaluated on 25 open-source benchmark apps and eight real-world EBSs. The evaluation exhibited my technique's higher accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities on event attacks than existing techniques as well as its applicability to real-world EBSs.

AB Digital technologies are reshaping our world and are becoming an integral part of our being. It became obvious that in modern days digitalization in each industry is an irreversible process and the speed of adopting of such kind of technologies in an appropriate manner will determine the evolution and survival of any business. Digital technologies play a crucial role in any domain of our life: from simple everyday activities, to such important domains like security, safety and health. We are the witnesses of so-called "Industry 4.0 Revolution" which is dominated by Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Architectures with related technologies. When we think about big change or (r)evolution, we are looking mostly for advantages only, but don't care about challenges and what is happening under the hood.
   The truth is that "reality is distributed" and the things are getting more complex with each passing day. The information systems are dealing with more and more (huge) amount of data, nevertheless, a quick response (in milliseconds) is expected and no downtime is accepted. In this context, the challenges consist first of all in designing and implementing a reliable (doing well what it was designed for), performant (quick reaction time), low-overhead (non-blocking and optimal use of resources) and flexible (adding new features with minimal effect upon production environment) systems. To implement a system with such kind of features a specific programming models need to be used.
   In this paper is proposed an architectural approach aimed to ensure scalability and extensibility of a distributed information systems using not fresh, but still very actual concept like Actor Model and REST. Modern Event-Driven, Asynchronous and non-blocking programming models are used.

AB This work presents an ultra-low-power software-defined always-on wake-up system to drastically decrease the system power of Internet of Things (IoTs) devices, which usually operate in random-sparse-event (RSE) scenarios. It mainly thanks to a clock-free time-shielding level-crossing ADC (TS-LCADC), software-defined clock-free multi-function detectors, and an asynchronous pipelined event-driven architecture. First, by quantifying RSE noisy signals with clock-free adaptive sampling in a signal-noise-rejecting manner, the proposed TS-LCADC reduces number of sampling points and power, and consumes only 41 nW when on-call waiting for IoT events. Second, the proposed clock-free multi-function detectors with offline and online programmability are able to character the signal features of versatile IoTs events and allow versatile and dynamic wake-up functions. Third, the proposed asynchronous pipelined event-driven architecture minimizes the system activity and thus power, because a power-hungry high-performance system (HPS) is only woken up when a detected parameter crosses its corresponding threshold. As such, the long-term average power (LTA-power) is dominated by the always-on circuits in RSE scenarios. The measurement results achieve 71-75 nW for three typical applications, i.e., heart rate, epilepsy, and keyword envelope detection. The LTA power is only 57 nW when waiting for RSE events, which is 30x lower than a prior general-purpose wake-up chip. Compared with other works of dedicated voice and acoustic wake-up functions, this work consumes 2x and 17x less power, respectively, while featuring 16x higher signal bandwidth and a broader versatility.

AB In a cellular network, signaling and data messages exchanged between network elements are an extremely valuable information for network optimization. The consideration of different types of information allows to improve the optimization results. However, the huge amount of information has made it very difficult for operators to process all the available information. To cope with this issue, in this paper, a methodology for processing cell and user connection traces to optimize a live cellular network is presented. The aim is to generate new performance indicators different from those supplied by manufacturers, taking advantage of the ability of complex event processing tools to correlate events of different nature. For illustrative purposes, an example of how a new performance indicator is created from real traces by complex event processing is given.

TI Model analysis for business event processing
SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
DT Article
AB Business event processing requires efficiently processing live events, computing business performance metrics, detecting business situations, and providing real-time visibility of key performance indicators. Given the high volume of events and significant complexity of computation, system performance-event throughput-is critical. in this paper, we advocate model-analysis techniques to improve event throughput. In the build time, a series of model analyses of the application logic are conducted to understand such factors as runtime data-access path, data flow, and control flow. Such analyses can be used to improve throughput three ways: at build time it can be used to facilitate the generation of customized code to optimize I/O and CPU usage; information about the control flow and data flow can be used to ensure that CPU resources are used effectively by distributing event-processing computation logic evenly over time; and at runtime, knowledge gained from the model can be used to plan multithreaded parallel event-processing execution to reduce wait states by maximizing parallelization and reducing the planning overhead. This paper presents a series of model-analysis techniques and the results of experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness.

AB Scaling Complex Event Processing applications is inherently problematic. Many state of the art techniques for scaling use filtering on producers, vertical scaling, or stratification of an Event Processing Network. The solutions usually aren't distributed and require centralized coordination. In this paper, we are introducing a technique for scaling Complex Event Processing in a distributed fashion and by taking semantic information of events into account. We are introducing two CEP models for scaling CEP architectures, providing core algorithms, and evaluating their performance.

AB Most approaches to application integration require an unambiguous exchange of events. Ontologies can be used to annotate the events exchanged and thus ensure a common understanding of those events. The domain knowledge formalized in ontologies can also be employed to facilitate more intelligent, semantic event processing, but at the cost of higher processing efforts.
   When application integration and event processing are implemented on the user interface layer, performance is an important issue to ensure acceptable reactivity of the integrated system. In this paper, we analyze different architecture variants of implementing such an event exchange, and present an evaluation with regard to performance. An example of an integrated emergency management system is used to demonstrate those variants.

AB As more and more services are deployed on devices near the network edge, security operations (such as authentication and authorization) need to move with them. Typically, edge devices have fewer resources than data center servers and so the security operations need to make more efficient use of what is available while offering adequate performance. Authorization adds latency and requires system resources, but the need for security management with strong authorization at the network edge is growing. We have released the first open source, high-performance, resource-efficient, XACML3 standard-compatible Policy Decision Point (PDP) called Luas (means "speed" in the Irish language) based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking computational model, using a Bloom Filter for better performance. We compared its performance, resource usage and reliability against existing open source PDPs. Like those we tested, it provides accurate decisions, but Luas offers much faster security policy evaluation while using fewer system resources, and provides responses in a reasonable timeframe even when resources are scarce.

AB Manufacturing enterprises strive for improvements in their monitoring and control of enterprise processes to sustain competitive advantages. In this context, enterprise integration (El) across various enterprise levels and event processing are indispensable. However in reality, enabling El and employing event processing for online monitoring and control of enterprise processes are elusive goals for many of the manufacturing enterprises. In the contribution, a framework for enabling El is elaborated, which can be considered as a building block towards realizing the aforementioned goals. The framework encompasses various components: data collection engine, data aggregation engine, event processing engine, performance measurement, and offline analysis. This framework can be exploited in enhancing online monitoring and control of enterprise processes by employing event processing. The framework has been implemented and validated in an industrial scenario.

AB Event logs of process-aware information systems play an increasingly critical role in today's enterprises because they are the basis for a number of business intelligence applications such as complex event processing, provenance analysis, performance analysis, and process mining. However, due to incorrect manual recording, system errors, and resource constraints, event logs inevitably contain noise in the form of deviating event sequences with redundant, missing, or dislocated events. To repair event logs, existing approaches rely on predefined process models to obtain a minimum recovery for each deviating event sequence. However, process models are typically unavailable in practice, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. In this scenario, can event logs be self-healing? To address this problem, we propose an approach that leverages compliant event sequences to repair deviating sequences. Our approach is effective if the compliant event sequences contain sufficient knowledge for repair. We implement our approach in a prototype and employ the tool to conduct experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve efficient repairs without the help of process models.

Complex Event Processing(CEP), which can be used to extract user level information from raw data, becomes the key part of the IoT middleware. Most of the current study of complex event processing has not focus on distributed uncertain event streams. In this paper, a high performance method over distributed uncertain event streams is proposed. This method uses improved matched tree that include node buffer list and probability calculation to detect complex event in single uncertain event stream. Distributed stream processing platform Storm also is brought in to improve the performance and stability. Based on Storm, two level parallel methods are proposed to increase the throughput. The experiment study shows that this method is efficient to process complex events over distributed uncertain event streams.

AB This paper presents an implementation case study for business-centric SOA test framework. The reference architecture of SOA system is usually layered: business process layer, set-vice layer, and computing resource layer. In the architecture, there are so many subsystems to affect system performance, moreover they relate with each other. As a result, in the respect of overall performance, it is usually meaningless to measure each Subsystem's performance separately. fit SOA system, the performance of the business process layer with which users keel) in contact depends on the summation of the performance of the other lower layers. Therefore, measuring performance of the business layer includes indirect measurement of the other SOA system layers. We devised it business-centric SOA test framework in which activities and control primitives in business process managers are simulated to invoke commands or services in a test scenario. That is, in the test framework, a real business process scenario can be replaced to a mimicked business process test scenario, which is executed in a test proxy based on event mechanism. In this paper, we present the concept of BPA simulation, 2-layered test suites Model, and reference architecture.

AB Big Data analytics is considered an imperative aspect to be further improved in order to increase the operating margin of both public and private enterprises, and represents the next frontier for their innovation, competition, and productivity. Big Data are typically produced in different sectors of the above organizations, often geographically distributed throughout the world, and are characterized by a large size and variety. Therefore, there is a strong need for platforms handling larger and larger amounts of data in contexts characterized by complex event processing systems and multiple heterogeneous sources, dealing with the various issues related to efficiently disseminating, collecting and analyzing them in a fully distributed way.
   In such a scenario, this work proposes a way to overcome two fundamental issues: data heterogeneity and advanced processing capabilities. We present a knowledge-based solution for Big Data analytics, which consists in applying automatic schema mapping to face with data heterogeneity, as well as ontology extraction and semantic inference to support innovative processing. Such a solution, based on the publish/subscribe paradigm, has been evaluated within the context of a simple experimental proof-of-concept in order to determine its performance and effectiveness.

AB Background: Based on the assumptions that depersonalization symptoms are relevant for test anxiety maintenance, we examined their frequency, psychological predictors, association with anxiety symptoms, and association with test performance. Sampling and Methods: In Study 1, 203 students rated their test anxiety severity and depersonalization in their last oral examination. In Study 2, we assessed test anxiety 1 week before an oral examination, depersonalization, safety behaviors, self-focused attention, and negative appraisals of depersonalization directly after the examination, and post-event processing 1 week later among 67 students. Results: In Study 1, 47.3% reported at least one moderate depersonalization symptom. In Study 2, test anxiety and negative appraisals of depersonalization significantly predicted depersonalization. Depersonalization was linked to a higher intensity of safety behaviors and post-event processing but not to self-focused attention. It was not related to performance. Conclusion: Results are limited by the non-random sampling and the small sample size of Study 2. However, by showing that depersonalization contributes to the processes the maintenance of test anxiety, the findings confirm that depersonalization - normally understood as an adaptive mechanism to cope with stressful events - can become maladaptive.

DE Complex Event Processing; Inference; Production Rule Systems
AB Reasoning systems tapping into the physical world often have to deal not only with temporal relations but also with spatial relations while performing complex event processing. Spatio-temporal relations are a special kind of relations as all events are intertwined via these relations. Treating spatio-temporal relations similarly to other relations will have a significant negative impact in the system performance while reasoning. Therefore, spatio-temporal relations have to be treated differently. JBoss Drools 6 is a production rule system which provides facilities for complex event processing with temporal relations but currently lacks capabilities for spatial reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism which provides such a capability. The mechanism is implemented directly in the events therefore no Drools source code modifications are necessary. The feasibility of such a mechanism is evaluated from the performance viewpoint. With our spatial reasoning implementation in place, Drools can be claimed capable for spatio-temporal complex event processing.

AB The increased digitization of several critical infrastructure services on Internet like home banking, online payments, etc. exposes them to a range of sophisticated information security attacks. Thus, there is an urgent need for strong collaboration between all governmental and non-governmental organizations in order to form the defenses by sharing. Sharing and analyzing sensitive traffic data is an important aspect to protect critical infrastructures. However, privacy concerns of the data contributors about sharing their sensitive data prevent them from gaining the benefits from collaboration, or at least weaken it to a degree of insufficiency. To cope with those privacy concerns, we extend our preceding work about constructing an efficient framework for personal collaborative event processing permitting information sharing and processing amongst administratively and geographically disjoint organizations. The structure is able to aggregating and correlating events coming from the organizations in near real-time while preserving the privacy of sensitive data even in case of coalition among the entities in the environment. The key novelty of the structure is the use of a pseudorandom oracle capability dispensed among the use of FOG structure among the organizations collaborating to the system for obfuscating the data, that permits for achieving a good level of privacy at the same time as guaranteeing scalability in both dimensions: horizontally (range of collaborators) and vertically (range of dataset per collaborator).

AB Event processing is the key part of the middleware of Internet of Things. There are some challenges in complex event processing for event cloud in internet of things, such as heterogeneous, massive data, distributed event processing and the occurrence time of each event is unknown. In order to resolve the challenges, a complex event processing method of internet of things event cloud is proposed in this paper. This is based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and design an efficient Complex Event Processing (CEP) that based on query plan, which supports imprecise timestamps and resolves the problem of disorder event. The experimental study shows that this method can process disorder event and the performance of the model and approach is better than normal methods when processing large-scale event cloud in internet of things.

AB BE-Tree is a novel dynamic data structure designed to efficiently index Boolean expressions over a high-dimensional discrete space. BE-Tree copes with both high-dimensionality and expressiveness of Boolean expressions by introducing an effective two-phase space-cutting technique that specifically utilizes the discrete and finite domain properties of the space. Furthermore, BE-Tree employs self-adjustment policies to dynamically adapt the tree as the workload changes. Moreover, in BE-Tree, we develop two novel cache-conscious predicate evaluation techniques, namely, lazy and bitmap evaluations, that also exploit the underlying discrete and finite space to substantially reduce BE-Tree's matching time by up to 75%.
   BE-Tree is a general index structure for matching Boolean expression which has a wide range of applications including (complex) event processing, publish/subscribe matching, emerging applications in cospaces, profile matching for targeted web advertising, and approximate string matching. Finally, the superiority of BE-Tree is proven through a comprehensive evaluation with state-of-the-art index structures designed for matching Boolean expressions.

AB A variety of ubiquitous computing devices, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensor network (WSN), are generating huge and significant events that should be rapidly processed for business excellence. In this paper, we describe how complex event processing (CEP) technology can be applied to ubiquitous process management based on context-awareness. To address the issue, we propose a method for context-aware event processing using event processing language (EPL) statement. Specifically, the semantics of a situation drive the transformation of EPL statement templates into executable EPL statements. The proposed method is implemented in the domain of ubiquitous cold chain logistics management. With the proposed method, context-aware event processing can be realized to enhance business performance and excellence in ubiquitous computing environments.

AB The efficiency of a WiFi system with dozens of base stations in relatively small physical area is determined by the optimal allocation of the radio channels to the mobile devices. Based on the increased penetration rate of the high traffic capable smartphones and accentuated usage of these devices in densely populated buildings intelligent hardware tools are needed to offer QoS level to the users. The Radio Resource Management (RRM) of IEEE 802.11 network is provided by a wireless LAN controller. This node maintains an allocated control connection to each of the base stations providing enhanced quality level of the WiFi hot zone services. Modern base stations have the capability to listen to the radio channels periodically to detect the received signal intensity. The controller samples periodically each of the radio channels without affecting the own radio frame processing and collects in this way radio resource usage. Based on specific criteria like the number of active nodes, traffic intensity, interference, noise intensity the periodically executed RRM management algorithm modifies the distribution of active channels on the supervised hot zone level. The radio signal intensity scanning task is considered to be performed by the base stations as a sampling process of individual sensors distributed in physical space. Eighteen WiFi access points with thirteen channel sensors in 2.4 GHz range and sixteen channel sensors in 5 GHz range were used to capture radio signal intensity in a densely populated building. Holding special criteria in the scanned signal intensity values is considered as a complex event. Clustering method based on similarity measure was used to analyse sensor grouping behavior of the wireless controller RRM algorithm. Our work is focused on the usability of different statistical metrics (i.e. Hurst, Davies-Bouldin, etc.) to characterize intrusion detection efficiency of the wireless LAN controller.

AB This brief presents an efficient complex event-processing framework, designed to process a large number of sequential events on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Unlike conventional structured query language based approaches, our approach features logic automation constructed with a new C-based event language that supports regular expressions on the basis of C functions, so that a wide variety of event-processing applications can be efficiently mapped to FPGAs. Evaluations on an FPGA-based network interface card show that we can achieve 12.3 times better event-processing performance than does a CPU software in a financial trading application.

AB According to cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (SAD), both anticipatory processing and post-event processing are core mechanisms in disorder maintenance leading to dysfunctional coping with social situations through negative self-evaluation and increased anxiety. To date, little is known about these processes during late childhood, a critical period for disorder development. Further, it remains unclear if dysfunctional rumination in children can be altered through psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive distraction. In the current study, children aged 9 to 13 years with SAD and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs, each: n = 30) participated in an experimental laboratory social stress task while anticipatory processing, post-event processing, subjective anxiety, self-evaluations, and autonomic arousal (skin conductance level) were assessed. Further, the impact of a brief cognitive distraction intervention on post-event processing was assessed. Children with SAD reported more negative anticipatory and post-event processing compared to HC children. Further, negative anticipatory processing was associated with higher subjective anxiety and reduced subjective performance ratings during the social stress task. In the aftermath of the stressor, distraction led to reduced subjective anxiety in the group with SAD and lower autonomic arousal in all children but did not alter post-event processing. The current study suggests that both anticipatory and post-event processing already play a key role in the maintenance of SAD in childhood. While distraction may be beneficial in reducing prolonged subjective anxiety and autonomic arousal after social situations, more research on interventions targeting ruminative processes is needed.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems extract interest situations from event flows based on event detection patterns. However, local event processing for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) has not been discussed yet. Besides, it is complex or impossible to discover such patterns in some applications of IoT. In this article, we design a complex event service to process event flows based on IoT resource models, which does not depend on existing patterns, and deals with both discrete events and continuous variables. To improve the CEP performance, local IoT resources are used for local event processing, and a lazy exchange method is designed to realize the collaborated event processing between network edges and a data center. Our evaluation shows that our solution is feasible and effective.

AB Artwork transportation processes are generally agreed-upon, and long running propositions between multiple partners that are specified over service level agreements, performance, and complex quality constraints to be maintained. The complexity of the constraints is defined by the sensitivity, value, and significance of artworks, where any recorded damage would probably leave undesired marks on the long-term, and diminish the lifetime of art pieces. Due to the uncontrollable, and unpredictable nature of the context during transportation, the specified constraints are often violated in real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the PACT-ART architecture to integrate advanced computing techniques with transportation activities. This integration counts on external and Internet of Things (IoT) services to draw and understand the context of activities, thus it paves a way to predict a future state of the ongoing process and point out any possible violation in advance. Moreover, PACT-ART combines Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques and makes this technology available even to non-experts in the domain. Finally, we showcase some initial experiments on real-life transportation scenarios that testify to the efficiency of our proposal.

DE complex event processing (CEP); out-of-order; suffix-automaton;
   searching-table
AB In recent years, there has been a growing need for complex event processing (CEP), ranging from supply chain management to security monitoring. In many scenarios events are generated in different sources but arrive at the central server out of order, due to the differences of network latencies. Most state-of-the-art techniques process out-of-order events by buffering the events until the total event order within a specified range can be guaranteed. Their main problems are leading to increasing response time and reducing system throughput. This paper aims to build a high performance out-of-order event processing mechanism, which can match events as soon as they arrive instead of buffering them till all arrive. A suffix-automaton-based event matching algorithm is proposed to speed up query processing, and a confidence-based accuracy evaluation is proposed to control the query result quality. The performance of our approach is evaluated through detailed accuracy and response time analysis. As experimental results show, our approach can obviously speed up the query matching time and produce reasonable query results.

AB Research has shown that social anxiety generalises to sporting and athletic situations. The present study explored the applicability of the Clark and Wells model of social anxiety - and its metacognitive extension - to sport anxiety. Participants were 290 students aged 11-13 years, who completed measures of sport anxiety, social anxiety, depression and cognitive variables implicated by the model. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that performance attitudes, performance cognitions, anticipatory and post-event processing were predictive of sport anxiety, after controlling for social anxiety and depression. In addition, the association between performance attitudes and sport anxiety was stronger at higher levels of anticipatory and post-event processing. These results suggest that the Clark and Wells cognitive model - and its metacognitive extension - is applicable to children with sport anxiety.

AB Numerous studies have shown that social phobia patients experience negative self-impressions or images during social situations. Clark and Wells (1995) posited that such negative self-images are involved in the maintenance of social phobia. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of negative self-imagery on cognition and emotion during and following a brief social situation. Specifically, high and low socially anxious participants (N = 77) were instructed to hold either a negative or control self-image as they engaged in a brief speech. Participants then rated their anxiety, performance, cognitions, and focus of attention. Twenty-four hours later, they returned to the laboratory and completed questionnaires assessing the amount of post-event processing (PEP) they engaged in. The results showed that, irrespective of the level of social anxiety or depressive symptoms, participants that held the negative self-image experienced higher levels of anxiety, were more self-focused, experienced more negative thoughts, rated their anxiety as more visible, appraised their performance more negatively, and engaged in more negative and less positive PEP than participants that held the control self-image. Collectively the results indicate that negative imagery is causally involved in the maintenance of social phobia, as well as in the generation of social anxiety among non-anxious individuals.

AB Agent-based decision aids can improve their performance by mining domain knowledge captured in cognitive domain ontologies (CDOs). This paper introduces a cognitively enhanced complex event processing (CECEP) architecture to enable enhanced agent-based decision making. Additionally the paper examines the parallelization and acceleration of a key knowledge mining process within the architecture on high performance computing platforms. Speedups of almost a 1000 times were seen using 8 NVIDIA Tesla C2070 GPGPUs over 1 Xeon X5650 processor core. Speedups of this level will allow more complex knowledge domains to be searched in real time on reactive agents and thus enable systems with enhanced intelligence to be designed.

AB The QuickSilver (TM) Event Processing Module (EPM) designed for the Siemens Inveon (TM) Dedicated PET (Positron Emission Tomography) preclinical scanner, has been leveraged in the development of a new SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) EPM module. This new module is used in Inveon SPECT systems and provides 16 channels of high speed data acquisition and event processing functions. Fifteen of these channels are used for processing 7 X signals, 7 Y signals and a SUM signal all received from the SPECT detector electronics. Custom mixed-signal CMOS ASICs and high speed ADCs are utilized to provide the front-end analog portion of the data acquisition. A high performance FPGA provides the digital portion of the data acquisition running at 100 MHz and the subsequent event processing. This FPGA also provides multiple high speed serial data channels for external interconnection. These interconnections allow the module to be replicated as needed in a distributed parallel processing architecture for flexible, high performance SPECT imaging. The module also provides controllable high voltage needed to bias the SPECT detectors. A four head, NaI(TI) based SPECT system is currently being built using one SPECT EPM per SPECT head.

AB Fuzzy complex event processing-based decision-making systems have received considerable research interests recently. In particular, a well-managed operator distribution is required for improving the performance of the fuzzy complex event processing-based decision-making systems. However, the intrinsic uncertainty in dynamic input events increases the difficulties of operator distribution problem. To address these issues, a cost-aware, fault-tolerant and reliable strategy, called CaFtR is proposed for operator scheduling on fuzzy complex event processing systems based on the Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. The proposed CaFtR method adequately makes use of network resources to achieve continuous and highly available complex event processing regardless of dynamic operator migrations under fuzzy environment. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, and the utility of our work is demonstrated through an application on the StreamBase system.

AB Sensing events from dynamic environments are normally asynchronous and non-repeatable. This lack of repeatability makes it particularly difficult to statistically evaluate the performance of sensor network applications. Hence, it is essential to have the capability to capture and replay sensing events, providing a basis not only for system evaluation, but also for realistic protocol comparison and parameter tuning. To achieve that, we design and implement EnviroLog, a distributed service that improves repeatability of experimental testing of sensor networks via asynchronous event recording and replay. To use EnviroLog, an application programmer needs only to specify two types of simple annotations to the source code. Automatically, the preprocessor embeds EnviroLog into any desired level of an event-driven architecture. It records all events generated by lower layers and can replay them later to upper layers on demand. We validate the accuracy and performance of recording and replay through a set of microbenchmarks, using the latest XSM platforms. We further demonstrate the strength of EnviroLog in system tuning and performance evaluation for sensor network applications in an outdoor environment with 37 XSMs.

AB This paper gives an insight perspective for developing a business intelligence architecture to satisfy permanently growing controlling requirements in complex distribution networks. Supply Chain Management (SCM), as a part of management science concerning intelligent synchronization of supply and demand, is the basis for the development of flexible, proactive and adaptive real-time information systems, called Operational Business Intelligence (OpBI) systems, which offer a significant support for decision making on operational level. Application scenarios including concrete decision-problems are analyzed regarding system implementation and in consideration of supply chain performance. The conclusion reflects the development process in order to allow a foresight.

TI Optimization Techniques for RFID Complex Event Processing

AB One research crucial to wider adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is how to efficiently transform sequences of RFID readings into meaningful business events. Contrary to traditional events, RFID readings are usually of high volume and velocity, and have the attributes representing their reading objects, occurrence times and spots. Based on these characteristics and the Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) implementation framework, this paper studies the performance issues of RFID complex event processing and proposes corresponding optimization techniques. Our techniques include: (1) taking advantage of negation events or exclusiveness between events to prune intermediate results, thus reduces memory consumption; (2) with different selectivities of complex events, purposefully reordering the join operations between events to improve overall efficiency, achieve higher stream throughput; (3) utilizing the slot-based or B+-tree-based approach to optimizing the processing performance with the time window constraint. We present the analytical results of these techniques and validate their effectiveness through experiments.

AB Some people with aphasia may have trouble with verbs because of fundamental difficulties in processing situations in a way that maps readily onto language. This paper describes a novel assessment, the Order of Naming Test, that explores the conceptual processing of events through the order in which people name the entities involved. The performance of non-brain damaged control participants is described. The responses of two people with non-fluent aphasia are then discussed. Both 'Helen' and 'Ron' showed significant difficulty with verbs and sentences. Ron also had trouble on a range of tasks tapping aspects of event processing, despite intact non-verbal cognition. While Helen's performance on the Order of Naming Test was very similar to the controls, Ron's differed in a number of respects, suggesting that he was less focused on the main participant entities. However, certain aspects of his response pointed at covert event processing abilities that might be fruitfully exploited in therapy.

AB Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology applied ubiquitously uses radio frequency waves to automatically track tagged objects and collect data. After reading tagged objects, the RFID reader generates primitive events that contain very limited semantic information. A complex event is defined to communicate with high level applications. How to efficiently generate a complex event from a large amount of primitive events is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a complex event processing method based on pre-grouping readers. Our approach effectively filters out the unrelated events to reduce the number of redundant checking events. The experimental results show that our method provides a high performance solution for the complex event processing in RFID designs.

AB The vehicle exhaust gas emission is directly related with the quality of air. This paper describes the research and development of an event driven RFID based exhaust gas detection system applying the service oriented architecture for the purpose of environmental protection. An edge engine supporting the EPCglobal ALE specification, a complex event processing engine dealing with the complex streaming RFID events and service bus, which are involved in the architecture of the system, are discussed both separately and in a whole picture. The edge engine is composed of four modules, which are kernel module, device management module, events filter module, and configuration module. It provides features to encapsulate the applications from device interfaces; to process the raw observations captured by the readers and sensors; and to provide an application-level interface for managing readers and querying RFID observations. Event processing engine consists of a network of event processing agents running in parallel that Internet using a dedicated event processing infrastructure, which provides an abstract communication mechanism and allows dynamic reconfiguration of the communication topology between agents at run-time. Web Services and asynchronous APIs are pivotal system implementation for flexible components reuse, dynamic configuration and optimized performance. Service bus, through its service integration and management capabilities, is the backbone of the system. Lastly, the system Is proven to be effective with high performance in the benchmark.

AB Aims: Post-event processing (PEP) in social anxiety disorder (SAD) involves ruminating about social encounters after the fact. There is a clear relationship between PEP and SAD, but less is known about the negative effects of PEP. The goal of the current study was to investigate these negative effects in a sample of people with SAD. We hypothesized that PEP would contribute to decreased willingness to try a similar task again and to increased anxiety about engaging in a similar task. We also hypothesized that the degree of PEP would mediate the relationship between initial self-evaluation of performance and follow-up self-evaluation.
   Methods: Forty-one individuals with a principal diagnosis of SAD completed the study. Participants completed baseline measures of symptom severity and state affect and then completed an impromptu speech task. After completing the speech, they completed a self-evaluation of their performance. Five days later, they rated the degree to which they engaged in PEP about their speech performance, indicated their willingness and anxiety about completing a similar speech task in the future, and completed a second self-evaluation of their performance.
   Results: PEP contributed unique and significant variance to willingness (R-2 change=.12, p<.05) but not to anxiety ratings (R-2 change=.027, p=.13) once symptom severity, depressive symptoms, and state anxiety were controlled for. Using bias-corrected bootstrapping, PEP mediated the relationship between initial and follow-up performance ratings.
   Conclusions: The more people engage in PEP, the less willing they appear to be to re-enter difficult social situations, likely perpetuating a cycle of avoidance. PEP also appears to be one factor that keeps negative self-perceptions "alive" after a challenging social situation. The current study provides unique evidence of the negative consequences of PEP for individuals with SAD. (C) Copyright 2016 Textrum Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A stepwise approach to developing staged applications
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
DT Article
DE Concurrency; Threads; Event-driven; Staged events
AB The staged event-driven architecture (SEDA) can be seen as a milestone as regards integration of threads and events in a single model. By decomposing applications into sets of multi-threaded stages connected by event queues, SEDA allows for the use of each concurrency model where most appropriate. Inside each SEDA stage, the number and scheduling policy of threads can be adjusted to enhance performance. SEDA lends itself to parallelization on multi-cores and is well suited for many high-volume data stream processing systems and highly concurrent event processing systems. In this paper, we propose an extension to the staged model that decouples application design from specific execution environments, encouraging a stepwise approach for designing concurrent applications, similar to Foster's PCAM methodology. We also present Leda, a platform that implements this extended model. In Leda, stages are defined purely by their role in application logic, with no concern for locality of execution, and are bound together through asynchronous communication channels, called connectors, to form a directed graph representing the flow of events inside the application. Decisions about the configuration of the application at execution time are delayed to later phases of the implementation process. Stages in the application graph can then be grouped to form clusters, and each cluster is mapped to an exclusive OS process, running on an arbitrary host. Finally, we discuss two example applications which we developed to evaluate the Leda platform.

AB Electric Vehicles (EV) are increasingly becoming the mainstream for the automotive industry. EV drives research in many diverse areas such as charging, battery performance, and autonomous driving. The volume, velocity and variety of data and events generated by a typical EV is very large. In this paper, we describe a hybrid architecture that consists of embedded and cloud-based modules to monitor and process EV event in near real-time, which is developed as a part of ITEA2 Smart M2M Grids Project [1]. The platform has a custom designed event processing hardware with network connectivity and module adapters to receive/transmit real time data such as those coming from the automotive Control Area Network (CAN) Bus. The platform includes software to apply rules and policies on real-time events. In this paper, we demonstrate its use with a simulation that includes a risk assessment scenario to check the reachabilities of nearest charging stations based on the current state of EV and observe the performance results.

AB Identifying the significant and most needed information in huge enterprises at the right time not only helps in decision making, but also plays an important role in overall performance and profit making of enterprises. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a developing method of processing different events from multiple sources and filtering them to produce complex events. This paper provides a methodology to model CEP using Timed Net Condition Event System (TNCES), a Petri Nets derived formalism. Petri Nets is a graphical, mathematical modelling language used to analyze and describe discrete-event dynamic systems. The biggest advantage of representing CEP in TNCES is that it opens paths to the validation of the events filtering and decision making in different level of enterprise.

AB Several application domains involve detecting complex situations and reacting to them. This asks for a Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine specifically designed to timely process low level event notifications to identify higher level composite events according to a set of user-defined rules. Several CEP engines and accompanying rule languages have been proposed. Their primary focus on performance often led to an oversimplified modeling of the external world where events happens, which is not suited to satisfy the demand of real-life applications. In particular, they are unable to consider, model, and propagate the uncertainty that exists in most scenarios. Moving from this premise, we present CEP2U (Complex Event Processing under Uncertainty), a novel model for dealing with uncertainty in CEP. We apply CEP2U to an existing CEP language-TESLA-, showing how it seamlessly integrate with modern rule languages by supporting all the operators they commonly offer. Moreover, we implement CEP2U on top of the T-Rex CEP engine and perform a detailed study of its performance, measuring a limited overhead that demonstrates its practical applicability. The discussion presented in this paper, together with the experiments we conducted, show how CEP2U provides a valuable combination of expressiveness, efficiency, and ease of use.

DE Internet of things; Complex event processing; Distributed probabilistic

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), enormous events are produced every day. Complex Event Processing (CEP), which can be used to extract high level patterns from raw data, becomes the key part of the IoT middleware. In large-scale IoT applications, the current CEP technology encounters the challenge of massive distributed data which cannot be handled by most of the current methods efficiently. Another challenge is the uncertainty of the data caused by noise, sensor error or wireless communication techniques. In order to solve these challenges, in this paper a high-performance complex event processing method over distributed probabilistic event streams is proposed. With the ability to report confidence for processed complex events over uncertain data, this method uses probabilistic nondeterministic finite automaton and active instance stacks to process a complex event in both single and distributed probabilistic event streams. A parallel algorithm is designed to improve the performance. A query plan-based method is used to process the hierarchical complex event from distributed event streams. Query plan optimization is proposed based on the query optimization technology of probabilistic databases. The experimental study shows that this method is efficient in processing complex events over distributed probabilistic event streams. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with a recent design of event-driven observer-based smart sensors for output feedback control of linear systems. We re-design the triggering mechanism proposed in a previously reported system with the implementation of self-sampling data smart sensors; as a result, we improve its performance. Our approach is theoretically supported by using Lyapunov theory and numerically evidenced by controlling the inverted pendulum on the cart mechanism.

AB Background: A recent proposal is that verb retrieval difficulties in some people with aphasia may reflect impairment to processes that construct event representations in a language-appropriate way. This level of processing has been termed "thinking for speaking" (Slobin, 1996), "conceptual preparation" (Level, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999), or "event processing" (Marshall, Pring, & Chiat, 1993).
   Aims: The present Study aims to extend understanding of this early stage of language production and the implications of its impairment. We examine verbs and sets of noun phrases produced in picture descriptions, comparing two people with disproportionate verb retrieval difficulties, and analyse their performance with respect to variables deemed to affect event processing. One person, EM, is argued to have event-processing difficulties, while the other, MH, is argued to have difficulties primarily in retrieving lexical verb forms.
   Methods & Procedures: The two participants with aphasia were compared on a picture description task, with target descriptions provided by control data. The study examined effects of stimulus format (photograph vs line drawing) and complexity of the situation (whether a single act, process, or state was the focus, versus a combination of these). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed.
   Outcomes & Results: The event-processing variables influenced the sets of noun phrases produced by EM and not MH, as per our predictions. However, statistically reliable effects were not evident in rates of verb retrieval. Error analyses revealed that EM focused on nontarget aspects of the situation in many of her descriptions, while MH retained target situation type despite his verb retrieval deficit.
   Conclusions: The performance of the two participants dissociated with respect to event-processing variables. This study extends understanding of the consequences of impaired event processing on language production, and suggests a novel and theoretically motivated means of examining the communicative abilities of people with aphasia.

AB Post-event processing (PEP), the act of engaging in a detailed, self-focused, and negative analysis of a prior social situation, has been hypothesised to contribute to the maintenance of social phobia (Clark & Wells, 1995). In light of this proposal, the present study investigated whether deliberate engagement in PEP as opposed to distraction following a speech task elicits unhelpful effects on emotion, cognition, and behaviour in a subsequent speech task in high and low socially anxious participants. The PEP manipulation instructed participants to focus on the anxious thoughts, images, feelings, and somatic sensations relating to the first speech. Contrary to hypotheses, results demonstrated that engaging in PEP as opposed to distraction led to a number of constructive outcomes such as: increased willingness among low socially anxious participants to give the second speech, a reduction in negative performance appraisals and underestimation of performance among high socially anxious participants, and better self-perceived speech quality irrespective of social anxiety level. However, there were no effects of response condition on anxiety, performance appraisals, observable behaviour, and negative cognitions. The findings underscore the need for additional research identifying the precise contents, construals, and processing modes that distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive forms of PEP.

AB With the Internet of Things expansion, there has been an increase in the development of services and applications that use context-aware devices incorporated into smart environments. Those devices produce large quantities of data and demand faster and more precise defense mechanisms. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an emerging and promising technology that allows real-time analysis of continuous data-steams. In this work, we proposed and developed a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) detection system and evaluated its performance running on a Raspberry Pi. The results show that the system can be executed on devices with reduced computational power and that CEP is a viable solution to improve the real-time performance on the detection of DDoS attacks on IoT environments.

AB It is becoming increasingly crucial to integrate pattern matching functionality over live and archived event streams with hybrid event queries for various complex event processing(CEP) applications. As existing Stream Processing Engine(SPE) and DBMS alone can not accommodate hybrid event queries, we investigate system integration issues and scheduling algorithm optimizations of hybrid event processing based on discrete pattern in a single framework. First, hierarchical event stream storage is introduced to synchronize data access over live/archived event streams. Second, live and historical partial pattern matching caching mechanisms are proposed to provide effective partial pattern match search and update. Third, to reduce database access over-head, sub-window based event detect scheduling algorithms are proposed. Empirical performance study in a prototype hybrid event processing engine demonstrates effectiveness of our approaches.

DE Complex Event Processing; Dynamic Query Distribution
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is heavily used in real time systems where people are interested in extracting valuable information from event streams. In CEP systems, some event processing nodes can get overloaded due to event bursts, thus degrading the overall throughput of the whole system. Dynamic distribution of queries among nodes is required in such situations.
   This paper presents a dynamic query distribution mechanism that can be employed on distributed CEP systems. It is capable of optimally distributing queries across nodes of the distributed CEP system when adding new queries to the system, adding new processing nodes to the system, and when CPU and memory utilization of a node exceeds the threshold value. Evaluation of the system shows that proper execution of the algorithm helps to maintain the overall system performance amidst event bursts.

AB Target data for tactical moving objects are streaming data collected in real time via radar, sonar, and other sensors. A system of continuous complex event query with dynamic rule definitions and high performance is needed to process that target data. We develop a continuous complex event query system with rule-based layered architecture. A continuous processing flow is decomposed into four modules hierarchically, which are event filtering, event capture, Continuous Queries (CQ) and Complex Event Processing (CEP). Each module has its responsibility but works together for a completed continuous processing flow. This paper shows that it is possible to dynamically insert, update, delete and search rule specifications of each layered modules through the decomposition of the whole system. Many rules are registered in the system for processing input event data continuously in real time. To improve the performance of getting matching CQs for each incoming event, CQ index is developed. Finally, experimentations and performance evaluations are carried out.

AB The present study aimed at investigating how frequently and intensely depersonalization/derealization symptoms occur during a stressful performance situation in social phobia patients vs. healthy controls, as well as testing hypotheses about the psychological predictors and consequences of such symptoms.
   N=54 patients with social phobia and N = 34 control participants without mental disorders were examined prior to, during, and after a standardized social performance situation (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). An adapted version of the Cambridge
   Depersonalization Scale was applied along with measures of social anxiety, depression, personality, participants' subjective appraisal, safety behaviours, and post-event processing. Depersonalization symptoms were more frequent in social phobia patients (92%) than in controls (52%). Specifically in patients, they were highly positively correlated with safety behaviours and post-event-processing, even after controlling for social anxiety.
   The role of depersonalization/derealization in the maintenance of social anxiety should be more thoroughly recognized and explored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN

AB Integration of heterogeneous and distributed systems is a challenging task, because they might be running on different platforms and written with different implementation languages by multiple organizations. Data-centricity and event-driven architecture (EDA) are concepts that help to implement versatile and well-scaling distributed systems.
   This paper focuses on the implementation of inter-subsystem communication in a prototype distributed remote handling control system developed at Divertor Test Platform 2 (DTP2). The control system consists of a variety of heterogeneous subsystems, including a client server web application and hard real-time controllers. A standardized middleware solution (Data Distribution Services (DDS)) that supports a data-centric EDA approach is used to integrate the system.
   One of the greatest challenges in integrating a system with a data-centric EDA approach is in defining the global data space model. The selected middleware is currently only used for non-deterministic communication. For future application, we evaluated the performance of point-to-point communication with and without the presence of additional network load to ensure applicability to real-time systems. We found that, under certain limitations, the middleware can be used for soft real-time communication. Hard real-time use will require more validation with a more suitable environment.

AB With the recent development of the Internet of Things, produced data are increasing day by day. These data have to be analyzed in real time. To provide real time analysis, Complex Event Processing is proposed to analyze the continuous and timely annotated data. Complex event processing detects complex events from atomic events via predefined rules which are mostly determined by domain experts. Determining complex event processing rules requires thorough knowledge of the data and data relations among data sources. It will be difficult to define a rule when it is considered that the scope and quantity of data is increased. Therefore, there is a need for extracting rules automatically. In this paper, we propose a novel model that extracts rules from unlabeled data by using clustering and rule mining algorithms. The model is evaluated in terms of classification performance and the results show that the proposed model is a promising solution for extracting complex event processing rules.

   locating
AB RFID-based tracking and locating system faces many challenges. In order to solve the problem, we build a model of RFID-based tracking and locating system which is based on complex event processing, that is BCEPS model. BICEPS model consists of physical device layer, RFID data processing layer, event processing engine, application layer, data storage layer. BCEPS model filters the RFID data which is gathered in real time and then generates RFID events. At the same time, BCEPS model responses to the requirement coming from users and then generates user events. RFID and user events are sent to event processing engine and are processed. Finally, results are returned to users. To enhance the efficiency of processing massive events and the real-time performance of system, we first propose and design the real-time event scheduling algorithm for event processing engine. Finally, we verify BICEPS model by implementing RFID-based tracking and locating system in underground mine.

ID OPTIMIZATION; PATTERNS
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a modern software technology for the dynamic analysis of continuous data streams. CEP is able of searching extremely large data streams in real time for the presence of event patterns. So far, specifying event patterns of CEP rules is still a manual task based on the expertise of domain experts. This paper presents a novel bat-inspired swarm algorithm for automatically mining CEP rule patterns that express the relevant causal and temporal relations hidden in data streams. The basic suitability and performance of the approach is proven by extensive evaluation with both synthetically generated data and real data from the traffic domain.

DE Complex event processing; Interval temporal logic; Regular expression
AB To improve the detective ability of complex event processing (CEP), we combine interval temporal logic (ITL) and regular expression in pattern description of event streams constraint. We propose different timed automata to support varied ITL. The pattern described by regular expression improves the simplicity of the pattern description. Meanwhile, we have implemented above technique in a CEP system to test performance. The experimental evaluation shows that the pattern can be efficiently and accurately matched.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) is defined as event processing for multiple stream sources to infer events that suggest complicated circumstances. As the size of stream data becomes larger, CEP engines have been parallelized to lake advantage of distributed computing. Typically, deployment of such a distributed CEP engine involves manual configuration, which has been regarded as an obstacle to its widespread adoption. In this demonstration, we present. CEP-Wizard, a framework of automatically configuring and deploying a distributed CEP engine with minimum effort. The demonstration shows that even inexperienced users can easily configure and deploy it on Apache Storm with achieving high performance and low resource usage.

DE EAS; OSGi; network management system; event processing
AB OSGi, regarded as the de facto standard framework for constructing component-based systems, has recently been extended to cover server applications, especially network management systems. Since it lacks event processing functions such as a function to prevent mass event cascades in component-based network management systems, this paper proposes and prototypes a unified event processing framework, named EAS+, based on OSGi EAS, which is system agnostic and can be customized freely by simple and well-structured rule definition files. In order to validate our proposal, we evaluate its performance by conducting several experiments and confirm its feasibility by applying it to the development of a management system for the 3GPP LTE mobile service. We believe that EAS+ is a useful development assistance tool and has the potential to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of developing component-based network management systems.

TI Wihidum: Distributed complex event processing
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
DT Article
DE Complex event processing; Distributed systems
AB In the last few years, we have seen much interest in data processing technologies. Although initial interests focused on batch processing technologies like MapReduce, people have realized the need for more responsive technologies such as stream processing and complex event processing. Complex event processing has been historically used within a single node or a cluster of tightly interconnected nodes. However, to be effective with Big Data use-cases, CEP technologies need to be able to scale up to handle large use-cases. This paper presents several approaches to scale complex event processing by distributing it across several nodes. Wihidum discusses how to balance the workload among nodes efficiently, how complex event processing queries can be broken up into simple sub queries, and how queries can be efficiently deployed in the cluster. The paper focuses on three techniques used for scaling queries: pipelining, partitioning and distributed operators. Then it discusses in detail the distribution of few CEP operators: filters, joins, pattern matching, and partitions. Empirical results show that the techniques followed in Wihidum have improved the performance of the CEP solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL
AB In Complex Event Processing (CEP), complex events are detected according to a set of rules that are defined by domain experts. However, it makes the reliability of the system decreased as dynamic changes occur in the domain environment or domain experts make mistakes. To address such problem, this study proposes a Sequence Clustering-based Automated Rule Generation (SCARG) that can automatically generate rules by mining decision-making history of domain experts based on sequence clustering and probabilistic graphical modeling. Furthermore, based on a two-way learning approach, the proposed method is able to support automated regular or occasional rule updates. It makes self-adaptive CEP system possible by combining the rule generation method and the existing dynamic CEP systems. This technique is verified by establishing an automated stock trading system, and the performance of the system is measured in terms of the rate of return. The study solves the aforementioned problems and shows excellent results with an increase of 19.32% in performance when compared to the existing dynamic CEP technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ID THREADS
AB The Staged Event Driven Architecture (SEDA) can be seen as a milestone as regards integration of threads and events in a single model. By decomposing applications into sets of multi-threaded stages connected by event queues, SEDA allows for the use of each concurrency model where most appropriate. Inside each SEDA stage, the number and scheduling policy of threads can be adjusted to enhance performance. SEDA lends itself to parallelization on multicores and is well-suited for many high-volume data stream processing systems and highly concurrent event processing systems.
   In this paper, we discuss the design of Leda, a platform that extends the staged model proposed by SEDA, decoupling application design from specific execution environments. In Leda, stages are defined purely by their role in application logic, with no concern for locality of execution, and are bound together through asynchronous communication channels, called connectors, to form a directed graph representing the flow of events inside the application. Decisions about the configuration of the application at execution time are delayed to later phases of the implementation process. Stages in the application graph can then be grouped to form clusters, and each cluster is mapped to an exclusive OS process, running on an arbitrary host.
   The paper briefly reviews a classification of hybrid concurrent models in order to establish SEDA's and Leda's role in this space. It then describes the design of Leda, which emphasizes decoupling at several levels, and discusses how its implementation in Lua helped to reinforce these design goals.

With current lack of universally usable GPGPU programming interface that gives optimal performance and debates about the style of implementing asynchronous computing in C++, we present a working implementation that allows a uniform and seamless approach to writing C++ code with continuations that allow processing on CPUs or CUDA/OpenCL accelerators. Performance results are provided that show, if corner cases are avoided, this approach has negligible performance cost on latency.

AB Monitoring provides well established means to track the exchanged messages in cross-organizational processes. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology used by monitoring systems that aims to process incoming events and generate high-level information. Current implementation of CEP has performance issues when the processing of events involves calling a composition of services to generate the required information. In this paper we develop a conceptual framework that relies on a set of patterns that maximize the parallel processing of incoming events. These patterns are used to split the composition of services into a set of blocks that can be executed in parallel while ensuring an effective correlation of the intermediate results. Our approach significantly decreases the processing time without requiring too many resources. We implemented a prototype of our framework and conducted performance evaluation in comparison with existing software.

AB With advances in World-Wide Web applications and technologies, research on measurement and modeling of Internet and Web-based information systems has become increasingly important. This paper focuses on continuously monitoring Web traffic by packet sniffing on high-speed links, which is the foundation of analyzing theoretical models of Web characteristics and evolvement. The author presents MOT, a memory online tracing system of Web traffic. MOT parses all packets in memory directly, without involving unnecessary I/O operations with magnetic disks to enhance the system performance. Event-driven design pattern and several other techniques are adopted in MOT to overcome the difficulties of buffering huge volume of traffic. MOT provides a fast, accurate and safe way to obtain the source data for many Web-related studies.

TI Virtualization considered harmful: OS design directions for

AB We argue that existing OS designs are ill-suited for the needs of Internet service applications. These applications demand massive concurrency (supporting a large number of requests per second) and must be well-conditioned to load (avoiding degradation of performance and predictability when demand exceeds capacity). The transparency and virtualization provided by existing operating systems leads to limited concurrency and lack of control over resource usage. We claim that Internet services would be far better supported by operating systems by reconsidering the role of resource virtualization. We propose a new design for server applications, the staged event-driven architecture (SEDA). In SEDA, applications are constructed as a set of event-driven stages separated by queues. We present the SEDA architecture and its consequences for operating system design.

AB We have previously proposed PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems), a discrete-event framework that binds real-time with model lime at sensors, actuators, and network interfaces. In this experimental effort we focus on performance issues and tradeoffs in PTIDES implementation. We address event processing performance with respect to other distributed discrete-event approaches that can be applied in a similar setting. The procedure is experimentally, evaluated on a distributed setup with standard software and networking components.

AB There are demands for alerts that use the results of intensive data analysis, such as relationships among events generated by many vehicles over a large area. These alerts require data analysis on servers. However, when a server receives massive amounts of data from vehicles, the processing latency increases because of the communication delays between the vehicles and the servers and the increased workload for data analysis on the server. Therefore we need to develop latency-tolerant alert-generating systems with scalable performance. In this paper, we report on a high-speed event-processing system architecture that integrates event processing in the in-vehicle systems with event processing in the servers. The in-vehicle system analyzes the vehicle's sensor data, detects events, and sends packets of the event information to the servers. The server has a stream-processing system, a pre-aggregation system, and a full-data-accumulation system. The stream-processing system receives the packets from the in-vehicle system. The pre-aggregation system creates and updates decision tables for the alerts repeatedly. The alerter of the stream-processing system generates alerts from the table. We implemented a prototype system to generate alerts about obstacles. We tested input data from actual vehicles and a traffic simulator and estimated the vehicles can receive the alerts within 1.2 sec even when the server receives massive data from 120,000 vehicles, which meets the performance requirement for our alert scenarios.

AB More and more real time applications apply RFID technology to identify, track and locate objects. Wide deployment of RFID readers will generate an unprecedented volume of primitive data in a short time. Duplication and redundancy of primitive data will affect real time performance of application. Thus, emerging applications must filter primitive data and correlate them for complex pattern detection and transform them to events that provide meaningful, actionable information to end applications. In this paper, we design and develop a complex event processing system called BICEPS. BCEPS will process RFID primitive data and event and perform data transformation. We design a simple complex event language for such transformation. For enhancing real time performance of application, we also design a priority-based event scheduling algorithm for event processing. We apply BCEPS to RFID-based tracking and locating system underground mine which we develop and illustrate the results.

AB Making use of the massive events from event sources such as sensors and bank transactions and extract valuable information is of significant importance. Complex Event Processing (CEP), a method of detecting complex events from simple events stream, provides a solution of processing data in real time fast and efficiently. However, a single node CEP system can't satisfy requirements of processing massive event streams from multitudinous event sources. Therefore, this article designs a distributed CEP system, which combine Siddhi, a CEP engine, and Storm, a distributed real time computation architecture. This system can construct topology automatically based on the event streams and execution plans provided by users and process the event streams parallel. Compared with single node complex event system, the distributed system can achieve better performance.

AB Location-based services can be used by enterprises to enhance the customer experience and improve workforce operational efficiency. The focus of our work is to provide a scalable architecture for location-based services which integrates into the enterprise communications platform to support new types of converged communications services involving real-time location processing. Unlike prior work in location servers and middleware, we separate application-level processing and raw location event stream processing into two separate components. We show analytically that this leads to performance advantage. By leveraging existing event driven architecture technologies, our approach integrates with the enterprise event bus, is highly scalable, and permits other real-time event streams to be used by location-based applications. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate the generality and validity of this approach.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) system enables extraction of higher-level information from real-time data streams produced by distributed sources. However, these systems are subject to changes in the user environment e.g., density of sources, rate at which events occur and mobile sources. Therefore, it becomes difficult to satisfy stringent performance requirements posed in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) demands under such a dynamic environment.
   This work investigates adaptive use of CEP mechanisms e.g., operator placement and operator migration by supporting transitions i.e., dynamic exchange of these mechanisms. In particular, we build a transition-capable CEP system - TCEP to enable integration of multiple heterogeneous CEP mechanisms and allow cost-efficient and seamless transitions between them. As a proof-of-concept, we have recently designed and developed an initial architecture named TCEP, where we have shown benefits of transitions among operator placement mechanisms. In an ongoing research, we explore other CEP mechanisms e.g., operator migration and investigate whether transitions can bring performance benefits, under the execution of different strategies. In the future, we will investigate if mechanism transitions in CEP are beneficial in middleware infrastructures including information-centric networks.

AB Operator Placement (OP) mechanism dictates the mapping of compute units, aka. operators on the network infrastructure based on the performance objectives requested by the end-user. The behavior of a placement is strongly influenced by the underlying environment e.g., the workload of queries or performance objectives of a large number of users. Due to this reason, it is not sufficient to build Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) just on a single placement mechanism, but it can benefit from an adaptive use of multiple placement mechanisms. Tcep provides this by (i) supporting key interfaces to develop OP mechanisms, (ii) allowing a dynamic exchange of OP mechanisms based on the user requirements and (iii) facilitating deployment of the operators on a wide range of network infrastructure. In this demonstration(1), we (i) provide an understanding on the behavior of OP mechanisms in TCEP on large-scale networks using GENI testbed(2) and (ii) show using the transition methodology in TCEP, that different OP mechanisms can be utilized to fulfill the performance requirements of a large number of users.

AB One research question crucial to RFID technology's wider adoption is how to efficiently transform sequences of RFID readings into meaningful business events. Contrary to traditional events, RFID readings are usually of high volume and velocity, and have the attributes representing their reading objects, occurrence times and spots. Based on these characteristics and the Non-deterministic Finite Automata(NFA) implementation framework, this paper studies the performance issues of RFID complex event processing and proposes corresponding optimization techniques. Our techniques include : (1) taking advantage of negation events or exclusiveness between events to prune intermediate results, thus reduce memory consumption; (2) with complex events' different selectivities, purposefully reordering the join operations between events to improve overall efficiency, thus achieve higher stream throughput; (3) utilizing the slot-based or B+-tree-based approach to optimize the processing performance with the time window constraint. We present these techniques' analytical results and validate their effectiveness through experiments.

DE RDF Stream Processing; CQELS; Complex Event Processing
AB The increasing popularity of Linked Data Streams has led to the developments of several RDF stream processing engines. Among them, CQELS has been developed with a native and adaptive approach, which gives it a performance advantage over other engines. In the traditional Complex Event Processing, temporal logics between events have a wide range of applications in the financial securities, traffic control, security control, health and other fields. However, existing RUE stream processing provides insufficient support for temporal logics and complex event detection. In some previous work, researchers have elaborated on the need for extending CQELS in the temporal logic and provided some theoretical ideas but failed to realize. In this paper, we extend the current version of CQELS with the support for temporal logics. Our implementation extends the CQELS language expressiveness and realizes complex event processing over linked data streams. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with experimental results comparing to the original CQELS implementation.

AB The paper introduces a method which allows quantitative performance and dependability analysis of systems modeled by using UML statechart diagrams. The analysis is performed by transforming the UML model to Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN). A large subset of statechart model elements is supported including event processing, state hierarchy and transition priorities. The transformation is presented by a set of SRN design patterns. Performance measures can be directly derived using SRN tools, while dependability analysis requires explicit modeling of erroneous states and faulty behavior.

AB Purpose: Post-event processing, defined by self-critical rumination following a stressful communication event, is significantly associated with reduced quality of life. However, despite its relevance to the stuttering experience, to date, only a few studies have investigated post-event processing among adults who stutter, and no study has identified clinical and psychosocial predictors of post-event processing. The purpose of this study was to determine the contributions of clinical markers of stuttering and psychosocial variables to post-event processing.Method: Adults who stutter (N = 96) participated in two virtual sessions. After completing the Trier Social Stress Test, a standardized social stress task in Session 1, participants completed measures of postevent processing, clinical markers of stuttering (i.e., the experience of stuttering, self-and observer-rated stuttering severity), and psychosocial characteristics (i.e., self-perceived perfor-mance, self-esteem, social anxiety, trait, and state self-compassion) in Session 2.Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that a more negative experience of stuttering, higher self-rated stuttering severity, and greater social anxiety predicted more post-event processing. Greater self-perceived performance and state self-compassion predicted less rumination. Observer-rated severity, self-esteem, and trait self-compassion were not significantly associated with post-event processing behavior.Conclusion: Findings reveal clinical and psychosocial variables to consider in the assessment and mitigation of post-event processing behavior in adults who stutter, and to bolster resiliency to social stress.Supplemental Material: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.24223213

AB In large and complex systems there is a need to monitor resources as it is critical for system operation to ensure sufficient availability of resources and to adapt the system as needed. While there are various (resource)-monitoring solutions, these typically do not include an analysis part that takes care of analyzing violations and responding to them. In this paper we report on experiences, challenges and lessons learned in creating a solution for performing requirements-monitoring for resource constraints and using this as a basis for adaptation to optimize the resource behavior. Our approach rests on reusing two previous solutions (one for resource monitoring and one for requirements-based adaptation) that were built in our group.

AB Technical innovations to improve production systems flexibility have been extensively investigated and are already available to industrial practice. However, the production companies' internal structures and processes must also meet these flexibility requirements in order for system adjustments to be efficiently carried out. Due to the direct influence on availability, performance and quality losses, maintenance is particularly relevant. Therefore, this paper considers the effects of flexibility on the promising strategy of predictive maintenance. With the digital twin, its update service and a labelling interface, the essential components of a predictive maintenance system for flexible production systems are introduced in detail. This application is based on a reference plant in the form of a flexible hybrid assembly system. The outlook discusses the transferability to other industrial use cases.

AB A new technique for performance regulation in event-driven systems, recently proposed by the authors, consists of an adaptive-gain integral control. The gain is adjusted in the control loop by a real-time estimation of the derivative of the plant-function with respect to the control input. This estimation is carried out by Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA). The main motivation comes from applications to throughput regulation in computer processors, where to-date, the testing of the proposed control technique has been assessed by simulation. The purpose of this paper is to report on its implementation on Intel's Haswell microprocessor, and compare its performance to that obtained from cycle-level, full system simulation environment. The intrinsic contribution of the paper to the Workshop on Discrete Event Systems is in describing the process of taking an IPA-based design and simulation to a concrete implementation, thereby providing a bridge between theory and applications.

AB With the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) becoming a reality, new approaches are needed to process real-time multimodal event streams. Existing approaches to event processing have limited consideration for the challenges of multimodal events, including the need for complex content extraction, and increased computational and memory costs. This article explores event processing as a basis for processing real-time IoMT data. This article introduces the multimodal event processing (MEP) paradigm, which provides a formal basis for native approaches to neural multimodal content analysis (i.e., computer vision, linguistics, and audio) with symbolic event processing rules to support real-time queries over multimodal data streams using the multimodal event processing language to express single, primitive multimodal, and complex multimodal event patterns. The content of multimodal streams is represented using multimodal event knowledge graphs to capture the semantic, spatial, and temporal content of the multimodal streams. The approach is implemented and evaluated within a MEP engine using single and multimodal queries achieving near real-time performance with a throughput of frames processed per second (fps) and subsec- ond latency of 0.075-0.30 s for video streams of similar to 30 fps input rate. Support for high input stream rates (45 fps) is achieved through content-aware load-shedding techniques with a similar to 127X latency improvement resulting in only a minor decrease in accuracy.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology in real-time distributed environments for analyzing fast and distributed streams of data, and deriving conclusions from them. CEP permits defining complex events based on the events produced by the incoming sources in order to identify complex meaningful circumstances and to respond to them as quickly as possible. However, in many situations the information that needs to be analyzed is not structured as a mere sequence of events, but as graphs of interconnected data that evolve over time. This paper proposes an extension of CEP systems that permits dealing with graph-structured information. Two case studies are used to validate the proposal and to compare its performance with traditional CEP systems. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the CEP extensions presented.

TI A Novel Complex Event Processing Engine for Intelligent Data Analysis in
   Integrated Information Systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
DT Article
AB Novel and effective engines for data analysis in integrated information systems are urgently required by diverse applications, in which massive business data can be analyzed to enable the capturing of various situations in real time. The performance of existing engines has limited capacity of data processing in distributed computing. Although Complex Event Processing (CEP) has enhanced the capacity of data analysis in information systems, it is still a big challenging task since events are rapidly increasing in diverse applications. In this paper, a lightweight intelligent data analysis system with a novel CEP engine named LIDA-E is introduced, which employs the knowledge base with rules and an event processing algorithm for analysis. Event models as well as operators support the rules for event selection and aggregation. These operators and rules have been utilized for constructing new CEP system architecture which combines expressiveness and efficiency in analysis. It adopts the agents and filter conception explicitly to provide the event transmission mechanism efficiently. Finally, the comparison between the proposed engine and the existing engine shows that LIDA-E has 48.65% averagely reduced time cost in different tests. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed architecture has better performance in both transmitting and analyzing a large number of events.

AB The rapid development of various types of real-time control systems raise new challenges on their heterogeneity and knowledge explicitly sharing issues. In this study, we propose an ontology-based model, named OntoEvent, to define and detect complex event in high-speed train control system. OntoEvent defines control logics using ontology structure and describes functionalities using logical, temporal operators and attribute relations. This ontology-based event processing model supports dynamic reconfiguration of functions and sharing between different components of the railway system. A pipelined construction framework is designed to transform OntoEvent model into semantic-consistent detection model. We implement a prototype control system, to evaluate the efficiency and performance of OntoEvent. Experimental results on this prototype system prove that OntoEvent-based event detection model outperforms other two selected models in results correctness, processing throughput and real-time performance, especially when processing a large amount of complex events.

TI Modeling an Radio Frequency Identification Asset Management Solution
   Hosted on a Cloud Service and Its Characterization
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING

ID RFID MIDDLEWARE; ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS
AB A web-based architecture of an radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking solution is proposed and deployed. The architecture attempts to depart from the typical localized approach of most RFID middlewares. The middleware has been replaced by a web service residing in a cloud. The traditional roles of the middleware such as tag data filtering, sorting, storage, and event processing have been redistributed amongst an RFID reader-based application and the web service. This architecture provides more flexibility and control to large scale RFID-based supply chain operations which are global in nature and unsuitable to the traditional localized middleware-based architecture of RFID tracking solutions. The feasibility of the web-based architecture is further augmented by validating performance parameters such as tag processing and primitive and complex event processing delay. Different subarchitectures are also proposed based on performance data for different scales of operations. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007862]

AB We present a dynamic security management framework where security policies are specified according to situations. Situation-based policies easily express complex dynamic security measures, are closer to business, and simplify the policy life cycle management. Situations are specified using complex event processing techniques. The framework is supported by a modular event-based infrastructure where a dedicated situation manager maintains active situations allowing the command center to take dynamic situation-based authorization and obligation decisions. The whole framework has been implemented and showed good performance by simulation. Finally, we detail two real experiments.

AB Due to the high information load to which everyone is exposed in her everyday life, the rise of new, systems fully supporting pervasive information distribution, analysis and sharing becomes a key factor to allow a correct and useful interaction among humans and computer systems. This kind of systems must allow to manage, integrate, analyze, and possibly reason on, a large and heterogeneous set of data.
   The SuNDroPS system, briefly described in this paper, applies context-aware techniques to data gathering, shared services, and information distribution; the system is based on a context-aware approach that, applied to these tasks, leads to the reduction of the so-called information noise, delivering to the users only the portion of information that is useful in their current context.

AB This study investigated self-reported state (anxiety, physical symptoms, cognitions, internally focused attention, safety behaviors, social performance) and trait (social anxiety, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional self-consciousness) predictors of post-event processing (PEP) subsequent to two social situations (interaction, speech) in participants with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and healthy controls (HC). The speech triggered significantly more intense PEP, especially in SAD. Regardless of the type of social situation, PEP was best predicted by situational anxiety and dysfunctional cognitions among the state variables. If only trait variables were considered, PEP following both situations was accounted for by trait social anxiety. In addition, dysfunctional self-consciousness contributed to PEP-speech. If state and trait variables were jointly considered, for both situations, situational anxiety and dysfunctional cognitions were confirmed as the most powerful PEP predictors above and beyond trait social anxiety (interaction) and dysfunctional self-consciousness (speech). Hence, PEP as assessed on the day after a social situation seems to be mainly determined by state variables. Trait social anxiety and dysfunctional self-consciousness also significantly contribute to PEP depending on the type of social situation. The present findings support dysfunctional cognitions as a core cognitive mechanism for the maintenance of SAD. Implications for treatment are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Infrastructure clouds revolutionized the way in which we approach resource procurement by providing an easy way to lease compute and storage resources on short notice, for a short amount of time, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. This new opportunity, however, introduces new performance trade-offs. Making the right choices in leveraging different types of storage available in the cloud is particularly important for applications that depend on managing large amounts of data within and across clouds. An increasing number of such applications conform to a pattern in which data processing relies on streaming the data to a compute platform where a set of similar operations is repeatedly applied to independent chunks of data. This pattern is evident in virtual observatories such as the Ocean Observatory Initiative, in cases when new data is evaluated against existing features in geospatial computations or when experimental data is processed as a series of time events. In this paper, we propose two strategies for efficiently implementing such streaming in the cloud and evaluate them in the context of an ATLAS application processing experimental data. Our results show that choosing the right cloud configuration can improve overall application performance by as much as three times.

DE Complex Event Processing; Aggregation; Sequence Pattern
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technology of choice for high performance analytics in time-critical decision-making applications. Yet while effective technologies for complex pattern detection on continuous event streams have been developed, the problem of scalable online aggregation of such patterns has been overlooked. Instead, aggregation is typically applied as a post processing step after CEP pattern detection, leading to an extremely ineffective solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that CEP aggregation can be pushed into the sequence construction process. Based on this insight our A-Seq strategy successfully aggregates sequence pattern online without ever constructing sequence matches. This drives down the complexity of the CEP aggregation problem from polynomial to linear. We further extend our A-Seq strategy to support the shared processing of concurrent CEP aggregation queries. The A-Seq solution is shown to achieve over four orders of magnitude performance improvement for a wide range of tested scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art solution.

AB Rapid evolution of Internet-of-Things is driving the increased deployment of smart sensors in environmental applications, contributing to many big data characteristics of environmental monitoring. Most of the current environmental monitoring systems are not designed to handle real-time datastreams, and the best practices for datastream processing and predictive analytics are yet to be established. This work presents a complex event processing (CEP) engine for detecting anomalies in real time, and demonstrates it using a series of real monitoring data from the geological carbon sequestration domain. We show that the service-based CEP engine is instrumental for enabling environmental intelligent monitoring systems to ingest heterogeneous datastreams with scalable performance. Our CEP framework requires minimal coding from the user and can be easily extended to other similar environmental monitoring applications.

   Computing; latency bound; QoS
AB Complex event processing systems process the input event streams on-the-fly. Since input event rate could overshoot the system's capabilities and results in violating a defined latency bound, load shedding is used to drop a portion of the input event streams. The crucial question here is how many and which events to drop so the defined latency bound is maintained and the degradation in the quality of results is minimized. In stream processing domain, different load shedding strategies have been proposed but they mainly depend on the importance of individual tuples (events). However, as complex event processing systems perform pattern detection, the importance of events is also influenced by other events in the same pattern. In this paper, we propose a load shedding framework called eSPICE for complex event processing systems. eSPICE depends on building a probabilistic model that learns about the importance of events in a window. The position of an event in a window and its type are used as features to build the model. Further, we provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping events and how many events to drop. Moreover, we extensively evaluate the performance of eSPICE on two real-world datasets.

AB IT operation analytics (ITOA) is used for discovering complex patterns in data from IT systems. The analytics process still includes a significant portion of human interaction which makes the analysis costly and error-prone. Human operators need to formulate queries over the collected data to identify the complex patterns. Since the queries describe complex relations, the queries are usually multilevel, perplexing, and complicated to create. For the querying the complex relations, complex event processing methods are successfully used in other domains. In this paper, we demonstrate an application of the complex event processing principles in the ITOA domain. We adjust T-Rex complex event processing engine and improve TESLA event processing language to suit for ITOA tasks. Our demonstration includes two real-world use-cases. We show the utilization of the complex event processing for root cause analysis and demonstrate the natural formulation of complex queries that results in the reduction of the volume of the required human interaction.

AB Various research communities have independently arrived at stream processing as a programming model for efficient and parallel computing. These communities include digital signal processing, databases, operating systems, and complex event processing. Since each community faces applications with challenging performance requirements, each of them has developed some of the same optimizations, but often with conflicting terminology and unstated assumptions. This article presents a survey of optimizations for stream processing. It is aimed both at users who need to understand and guide the system's optimizer and at implementers who need to make engineering tradeoffs. To consolidate terminology, this article is organized as a catalog, in a style similar to catalogs of design patterns or refactorings. To make assumptions explicit and help understand tradeoffs, each optimization is presented with its safety constraints (when does it preserve correctness?) and a profitability experiment (when does it improve performance?). We hope that this survey will help future streaming system builders to stand on the shoulders of giants from not just their own community.

AB Bushfire is the primary destructive force that may cause damage to a large region, a country, or even the Earth. However, as bushfires spread too fast, they are often identified when they cannot control and cause significant damage. The reason is that existing works on remote sensing focus on low-level information processing, and thus, face the challenge of processing a massive amount of data in real-time. In this work, we employ complex event processing (CEP) to extract higher-level information to facilitate real-time bushfire detection. In particular, we propose a "spatial extension" to the ready-powerful CEP techniques to enable bushfire monitoring from the combinations of multiple spatial events. We further demonstrate the proposed spatial-based CEP on a real-time bushfire detection problem. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well while achieving the competitive detection performance.

AB Complex event processing is an important, technology with possible application in supply chain management and business activity monitoring. Its basis is the identification of event patterns within multiple occurring events having logical, causal or temporal relationships.
   The Rete algorithm is commonly used in rule-based systems to trigger certain actions if a corresponding rule holds. The algorithm's good performance for a high number of rules makes it ideally suited for complex event detection. However, the traditional Rete algorithm does not support aggregation of values in time-based windows although this is a common requirement in complex event processing for business applications.
   We propose an extension of the Rete algorithm to support temporal reasoning, namely the detection of time-based windows by adding a time-enabled beta-node to restrict event detection to a certain time-frame.

AB Fault-tolerance (FT) support is a key challenge for ensuring dependable Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Many existing FT-support mechanisms for IoT are static, tightly coupled, and inflexible, and so they struggle to provide effective support for dynamic IoT environments. This paper proposes Complex Patterns of Failure (CPoF), an approach to providing FT support for IoT systems using Complex Event Processing (CEP) that promotes modularity and reusability in FT-support design. System defects are defined using our Vulnerabilities, Faults, and Failures (VFF) framework, and error-detection strategies are defined as nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) implemented via CEP systems. We evaluated CPoF on an automated agriculture system and demonstrated its effectiveness against three types of error-detection checks: reasonableness, timing, and reversal. Using CPoF, we identified unreasonable environmental conditions and performance degradation via sensor data analysis.

AB Time-correlated single photon counting continues to gain importance in a wide range of applications. Most prominently, it is used for time-resolved fluorescence measurements with sensitivity down to the single molecule level. While the primary goal of the method used to be the determination of fluorescence lifetimes upon optical excitation by short light pulses, recent modifications and refinements of instrumentation and methodology allow for the recovery of much more information from the detected photons, and enable entirely new applications. This is achieved most successfully by continuously recording individually detected photons with their arrival time and detection channel information (time tagging), thus avoiding premature data reduction and concomitant loss of information. An important property of the instrumentation used is the number of detection channels and the way they interrelate. Here we present a new instrument architecture that allows scalability in terms of the number of input channels while all channels are synchronized to picoseconds of relative timing and yet operate independent of each other. This is achieved by means of a modular design with independent crystal-locked time digitizers and a central processing unit for sorting and processing of the timing data. The modules communicate through high speed serial links supporting the full throughput rate of the time digitizers. Event processing is implemented in programmable logic, permitting classical histogramming, as well as time tagging of individual photons and their temporally ordered streaming to the host computer. Based on the time-ordered event data, any algorithms and methods for the analysis of fluorescence dynamics can be implemented not only in postprocessing but also in real time. Results from recently emerging single molecule applications are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument.

AB To address the problem of different time scales present in the simulation of solute transport through systems with a complex permeability structure such as fractured porous rocks, we propose a parallel discrete event simulation (DES) algorithm based on local time stepping criteria, specifically developed for the hybrid finite-element node-centred finite volume (FV) framework. A preemptive-event-processing (PEP) approach is applied to synchronise discrete events with sufficiently close time stamps, thereby facilitating the parallelisation for shared memory architectures. The accuracy of the presented DES-PEP scheme is first verified against the analytical solution of a 1D advection equation with spatially variable coefficients. The DES scheme is then applied to simulate tracer advection through a 3D model of highly heterogeneous fractured rock represented by an unstructured adaptively refined mesh with over 1 million elements. DES produces results comparable to those of a conventional time-driven simulation (TDS), but uses less than 1% of the execution time. Analysis of event distributions shows that updates occur almost exclusively in a small number of FV cells marked by order-of-magnitudes faster fluid flow and advection-dominated transfer, while slow-flowing cells remain inactive and excluded from computations. This focusing of the computational effort leads to high simulation efficiency while simultaneously diminishing round-off errors. Scalability tests with a parallel version of DES on shared memory demonstrate further computational speedups mirroring the increased number of threads. With the use of 20 threads, execution time is reduced from 42.5 days (with TDS) to only 1.5 hours, equivalent to a speedup of over 670. This parallel DES algorithm therefore enables efficient multi-core simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous geologically realistic systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Dependency isolation for thread-based multi-tier Internet services

AB Multi-tier Internet service clusters often contain complex calling dependencies among service components spreading across cluster nodes. Without proper handling, partial failure or overload at one component can cause cascading performance degradation in the entire system. While dependency management may not present significant challenges for even-driven services (particularly in the context of staged event-driven architecture), there is a lack of system support for thread-based online services to achieve dependency isolation automatically. To this end, we propose dependency capsule, a new mechanism that supports automatic recognition of dependency states and per-dependency management for thread-based services. Our design employs a number of dependency capsules at each service node: one for each remote service component. Dependency capsules monitor and manage threads that block on supporting services and isolate their performance impact on the capsule host and the rest of the system. In addition to the failure and overload isolation, each capsule can also maintain dependency-specific feedback information to adjust control strategies for better availability and performance.
   In our implementation, dependency capsules are transparent to application-level services and clustering middleware, which is achieved by intercepting dependency-induced system calls. Additionally, we employ two-level thread management so that only light-weight user-level threads block in dependency capsules. Using four applications on two different clustering middleware platforms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of dependency capsules in improving service availability and throughput during component failures and overload.

AB Through the IoT and Internet applications integration emerges the Web Of Things (WoT). Currently, WoT solutions generate data that can be used for decision making. Among the techniques of data flow analysis, one that has gained prominence is Complex Event Processing (CEP). Considering a WoT device may have connectivity, memory and processing power enough to perform CEP locally, it is possible to reduce the response time of data processing as a whole. Based on this premise, this work investigates the execution of a CEP system in an WoT device, analyzing the CPU and memory consumption in three scenarios: Mist (in the device itself), offloading in the Fog and offloading in the Cloud through WebSocket and HTTP protocols. The results show we can run CEP code on a WoT device, but its performance depends on the time window processing and the throughput of the data that reaches the device.

TI New parallel processing strategies in complex event processing systems

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
DT Article
DE Complex event processing; data stream; pattern operator; parallel
   processing; sensor network
AB Sensor network-based application has gained increasing attention where data streams gathered from distributed sensors need to be processed and analyzed with timely responses. Distributed complex event processing is an effective technology to handle these data streams by matching of incoming events to persistent pattern queries. Therefore, a well-managed parallel processing scheme is required to improve both system performance and the quality-of-service guarantees of the system. However, the specific properties of pattern operators increase the difficulties of implementing parallel processing. To address this issue, a new parallelization model and three parallel processing strategies are proposed for distributed complex event processing systems. The effects of temporal constraints, for example, sliding windows, are included in the new parallelization model to enable the processing load for the overlap between windows of a batch induced by each input event to be shared by the downstream machines to avoid events that may result in wrong decisions. The proposed parallel strategies can keep the complex event processing system working stably and continuously during the elapsed time. Finally, the application of our work is demonstrated using experiments on the StreamBase system regardless of the increased input rate of the stream or the increased time window size of the operator.

AB Distributed event-based systems are used to detect meaningful events with low latency in high data-rate event streams that occur in surveillance, sports, finances, etc. However, both known approaches to dealing with the predominant out-of-order event arrival at the distributed detectors have their shortcomings: buffering approaches introduce latencies for event ordering, and stream revision approaches may result in system overloads due to unbounded retraction cascades.
   This article presents an adaptive speculative processing technique for out-of-order event streams that enhances typical buffering approaches. In contrast to other stream revision approaches developed so far, our novel technique encapsulates the event detector, uses the buffering technique to delay events but also speculatively processes a portion of it, and adapts the degree of speculation at runtime to fit the available system resources so that detection latency becomes minimal.
   Our technique outperforms known approaches on both synthetical data and real sensor data from a realtime locating system (RTLS) with several thousands of out-of-order sensor events per second. Speculative buffering exploits system resources and reduces latency by 40% on average.

AB The development of Semantic Web technology has produced massive resource description framework (RDF) data, most of which are collected from the Internet of Things in the form of streams and analyzed in real time. How to reason and query RDF streams, and to mine valuable information from the streams for decision-making has become a hot research topic. Complex event processing (CEP) can perform real-time analysis of event streams, but the processed data usually lacks semantic information, is not suitable for semantic interoperability between multi-source heterogeneous data, and cannot combine data streams with domain ontology. In order to solve the above problems, CEPR, a complex event processing method based on RDF flow, is proposed. CEPR is based on answer set programming ASP, using LARS that extends ASP, combining Datalog and relational algebra, to implement RDF flow inference and query on the Flink platform. Use the PHM 2010 tool wear data set to evaluate the performance of CEPR, and compare CEPR with C-SPARQL and Strider. Experiments show that CEPR has a greater advantage in query latency.

DE Complex event processing; colored Petri-net; parallel processing; multi
   event pattern; business logic
AB Complex event processing (CEP) is a promising technology, which can evaluate the business logic from a large number of continuous real-time data streams. There are a few issues that are still remaining, such as linearization of processing realization mode and event pattern description, which would severely affect the detection efficiency of CEP. This paper proposes a CEP system that can efficiently share the associated event pattern and simultaneously process multiple event sources. First, an event presentation model and a complete set of event operators are summarized, on which a multi event pattern specification language with parallel output capability is proposed. Then, an extended colored Petri-net (CEP-PNm) is defined, which can effectively realize the proposed language and share the same nodes between event patterns in a variety of connection types. At last, by comparison with the traditional CEP system, a parallel processing system called PM-CEPs is introduced. The experimental results show that PM-CEPs can improve complex event processing performance horizontally and vertically through event pattern share and parallel processing.

AB The evolution of Android smartphone has increased the importance of touchscreen capabilities as user interaction as well as user input method. However, due to the limitation of Android architecture, every touch event may not create its corresponding display update all the times. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel technique of Touch Event Handling Block (TEHB) with capability of virtual touch event generation and low pass filters. TEHB is implemented on Android 2.2 and its performance simulations show that TEHB can achieve more performance gain than conventional triggering method.

   event processing (CEP)
AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for event-driven service invocation continues to increase, which is attracting interest in the techniques of complex event processing (CEP) for recognizing event patterns in the physical world from stream sensor data. To process data with lower delay, edge computing is widely used in IoT, but there are many challenges in implementing event recognition on such distributed computing systems. This paper studies an edge resource allocation problem for complex event processing; the result is an allocation scheme that allows all complex events contained in stream data to be detected in minimal time. As the intricate composition of event patterns and the large scale of the problem makes finding an optimal solution a hard problem, we formulate the problem as a constraint-based optimization problem (COP) using features of resources and events. We then propose a CEP-efficient heuristic algorithm (CEED) for efficient solution determination. Experiments conform that our algorithm can greatly reduce the time needed for problem solving while yielding good approximation performance relative to the baseline approach.

AB Operator placement has a profound impact on the performance of a distributed complex event processing system (DCEP). Since the behavior of a placement mechanism strongly depends on its environment; a single placement mechanism is often not enough to fulfill stringent performance requirements under environmental changes. In this paper, we show how DCEP can benefit from the adaptive use of multiple placement mechanisms. We propose TCEP, a DCEP system to integrate multiple placement mechanisms. By enabling transitions, TCEP can seamlessly exchange distinct operator mechanisms at runtime. We make two main contributions that are highly important for a cost-efficient transition: i) a transition strategy for efficiently scheduling state migrations and ii) a lightweight learning algorithm to adaptively select an appropriate placement mechanism as a consequence of a transition. Our evaluations for important decentralized placement mechanisms in the context of an IoT scenario show that transitions can better fulfill QoS demands in a dynamic environment. Thereby, efficient scheduling of state migrations can help to faster complete transitions by up to 94%.

AB This paper investigates how to complement Complex Event Processing (CEP) with dynamic quality monitoring mechanisms and support the dynamic integration of suitable sensory data sources. In the proposed approach, queries to detect complex events are annotated with consumer-definable quality policies that are evaluated and used to autonomously assign (or even configure) suitable data sources of the sensing infrastructure. We present and study different forms of expressing quality policies and explore how they affect the process of quality monitoring including different modes of assessing and applying quality-related adaptations. A performance study in an IoT scenario shows that the proposed mechanisms in supporting quality policy monitoring and adaptively selecting suitable data sources succeed in enhancing the acquired quality of results while fulfilling consumers' quality requirements. We show that the quality-based selection of sensor sources also extends the network's lifetime by optimizing the data sources' energy consumption.

AB Recent developments favor the adoption of IP-based protocols in automotive and aerospace domains. The increased connectivity between components helps to cut costs and enables better re-use of standardized components. However, increased connectivity also increases the attack surface of the overall system and necessitates dedicated security solutions. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for SOME/IP, a standardized automotive middleware protocol. Within the system, Esper, a complex event processing engine, applies a domain-specific rule set to a stream of SOME/IP packets. Possible attacks and protocol violations on the SOME/IP protocol are identified, suitable rules for detection are presented, and finally, the performance of the system is evaluated.

AB Quantitative Finance (QF) utilizes increasingly sophisticated mathematic models and advanced computer techniques to predict the movement of global markets, and price the derivatives and other assets. Being able to react quickly and intelligently to fast-changing markets is a decisive success factor for trading companies. To date, the rise of QF requires an integrated toolchain of enabling technologies to carry out complex event processing on the explosive growth and diversified forms of market metadata, in pursuit of a microsecond latency on an Exabyte-level dataset. Inspired by this, we present a data-driven execution paradigm that untangles the dependencies of complex processing events and integrate the paradigm with a big data infrastructure that streams time series data. This integrated platform is termed as the QuantCloud platform. Essentially, QuantCloud executes the complex event processing in a data-driven mode and manages large amounts of diversified market data in a data-parallel mode. To show its practicability and performance, we develop a prototype and benchmark by applying real-world QF research models on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data. Using this prototype, we demonstrate this platform with an application to: (i) data cleaning and aggregating (including the computing of logarithmic returns from tick data and the finding the medians of grouped data) and (ii) data modeling: the autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model. The performance results show that (a) this platform obtains a high throughput (usually in the order of millions of tick messages per second) and a sub-microsecond latency; (b) it fully executes data-dependent tasks through a data-driven execution; and (c) it implements a modular design approach for rapidly developing these data-crunching methods and QF research models. This platform resulting from an aggregated effort of the data-driven execution and big data infrastructure, offers the financial engineers with new insights and enhanced capabilities for effective and efficient incorporation of big data complex event processing technologies in their workflow.

DE Complex Event Processing (CEP); CEP architecture; Event Processing Agent
   (EPA); Realtime Streaming Analytics (RTSA)
AB Context: Complex Event Processing (CEP) architectures present high applicability in Realtime Streaming Analytics (RTSA) by extracting and generating valuable information from continuous data feeds, like in stock markets, traffic, and patient monitoring.
   Problem: Although guidelines and models for CEP architectures have been proposed, the composition of its inter-operable elements in charge of processing events, known as Event Processing Agent (EPA), is challenging for software architects.
   Solution: This work proposes EPAComp, a model that covers this gap and addresses large-scale processing requirements through features such as stream-based constructions and specialized EPAs.
   IS Theory: We employed the Representation theory to create a model representing information systems for event processing.
   Method: The model was applied in a real case experiment to create a solution to collect streams of events from around 200 systems and to provide a dashboard for monitoring their usage. Besides, industry experts qualitatively evaluated the proposal.
   Results: The experiment results show an application of the model to handle heterogeneous data in a scalable and efficient manner according to indicators regarding performance, the assertiveness of processed output, degree of cohesion, and coupling of components. The qualitative results present that experts asserted EPAComp capabilities fit RTSA requirements.
   Contributions: An architectural model for EPA composition that enhances the literature by (i) representing static and dynamic EPA compositions through arrangements of specific aggregation structures; (ii) defining the state-of-the-art event processing strategies in CEP; and, (iii) organizing the hierarchy of EPA types.

AB Mobile systems which include sensor networks, generate a continuous unmatched volume of primitive event streams with various properties where the interior semantic information of these events is generally very limited. Moreover, forwarding all these events to a central processing entity is not favored for limited-resource systems, it would deplete nodes' resources e. g., the energy.
   The goal of this work is to address these issues by extracting useful information locally, transmitting only this information and avoiding transmission of unnecessary low-level data between nodes. Therefore, an In-Network Distributed Complex Event Processing (INDCEP) based solution is proposed. INDCEP technology is used to perform the processing within the network by pushing complex event processing into network nodes. This research aims to develop a robust and high performance Distributed Complex Event Processing Engine for Mobile Systems (CEPEMS) based on aforementioned technology. It focuses on distributed event detection via disseminating distributed plans into a network of sensor nodes to perform complex event tasks. Furthermore, we present an optimization technique for the distributed queries and cost model to decide which query portions can be executed whether inside sensor nodes or at local CEP engine instance in a centralized point.

AB Emerging Big Data applications in areas like e-commerce and energy industry require both online and on-demand queries to be performed over vast and fast data arriving as streams. These present novel challenges to Big Data management systems. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is recognized as a high performance online query scheme which in particular deals with the velocity aspect of the 3-V's of Big Data. However, traditional CEP systems do not consider data variety and lack the capability to embed ad hoc queries over the volume of data streams. In this paper, we propose H2O, a stateful complex event processing framework, to support hybrid online and on-demand queries over realtime data. We propose a semantically enriched event and query model to address data variety. A formal query algebra is developed to precisely capture the stateful and containment semantics of online and on-demand queries. We describe techniques to achieve the interactive query processing over realtime data featured by efficient online querying, dynamic stream data persistence and on-demand access. The system architecture is presented and the current implementation status reported.

AB Thanks to its distributed and asynchronous medium access control mechanism, CAN is the ideal choice for interconnecting devices in event-driven systems. When timing requirements of applications are not particularly demanding, as in the case of, e.g., reactive and proactive maintenance, constraints on event delivery can be relaxed, so that their notification may rely on best-effort approaches.
   In this paper, a number of techniques are taken into account for notifying events in such a kind of systems, and their performance has been evaluated. Besides conventional CAN, a recent proposal for extending this protocol, termed CAN XR, is considered. Moreover, the adoption of Bloom filters to cope with rare events in very large systems has also been evaluated.

AB We investigate factors affecting the performance of caching to speed up discrete event simulation. Walsh and Sirer have shown that a variant of function caching (staged simulation) can improve the performance of simulation in a networking application. However, the effectiveness of caching depends significantly on cache size, the cost of consulting the cache, the hit rate, and the cost of completing the computation in case of a cache miss. We hypothesize that adaptive techniques can be used to optimize caching parameters and demonstrate an adaptive scheme that decides whether to utilize caching depending on observed cache performance and event processing times. We focus on evaluating quantitative relationships, using our own caching implementation with the P-Hold synthetic workload application running on the GTW simulation kernel. Experiments show that as the cache size is increased, performance improves to a point, then degrades, and also that the adaptive technique can substantially improve speedup.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is concerned with timely detection of complex events within multiple streams of atomic occurrences. It has useful applications in areas including financial services, mobile and sensor devices, click stream analysis etc. Numerous approaches in CEP have already been proposed in the literature. Event processing systems with a logic-based representation have attracted considerable attention as (among others reasons) they feature formal semantics and offer reasoning service. However logic-based approaches are not optimized for run-time event recognition (as they are mainly query-driven systems). In this paper, we present an expressive logic-based language for specifying and combining complex events. For this language we provide both a syntax as well as a formal declarative semantics. The language enables efficient run time event recognition and supports deductive reasoning. Execution model of the language is based on a compilation strategy into Prolog. We provide an implementation of the language, and present the performance results showing the competitiveness of our approach.

AB During the execution of business processes, companies generate vast amounts of events, which makes it hard to detect meaningful process information that could be used for process analysis and improvement. Complex event processing (CEP) can help in this matter by providing techniques for continuous analysis of events. The consideration of domain knowledge can increase the performance of reasoning tasks but it is different for each domain and depends on the requirements of these domains. In this paper, an existing approach of combining CEP and ontological knowledge is applied to the domain of logistics. We show the benefits of semantic complex event processing (SCEP) for logistics processes along the specific use case of tracking and tracing goods and processing related events. In particular, we provide a novel domain-specific function that allows to detect meaningful events for a transportation route. For the demonstration, a prototypical implementation of a system enabling SCEP queries is introduced and analyzed in an experiment.

TI It hurts but I still need it: a qualitative investigation of post-event
   processing in social anxiety disorder
SO BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
DT Article
DE post-event processing; rumination; social anxiety disorder; qualitative
   methods
AB Background: It has been proposed that both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs sustain engagement in post-event processing (PEP). However, it is unknown: (1) whether individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) actually derive the benefits from PEP that they expect; (2) if this is not the case, how their positive beliefs are maintained; and (3) if they are aware of the counterproductive effects of PEP, why they still perform PEP. Aims: To explore the phenomenology of the processes involved in PEP from the perspective of SADs, in order to address the research questions above. Method: Twenty-one participants suffering from SAD received individual semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Analysis revealed three main themes: (1) 'Only, safe and useful way to improve myself': SADs feel the need to improve their social performance, and they believe that PEP is the only, safe, and private way to do so, which is an underlying motive for them to do PEP; (2) 'It hurts more than helps me': however, through PEP, they do not seem to obtain the benefit that they expect, or only find a variety of counterproductive outcomes; (3) 'Better safe than sorry': they sometimes find makeshift solutions to improve their social performance during PEP, which may maintain their PEP as a form of intermittent reinforcement. They weigh up such costs and benefits, and choose to perform PEP while feeling conflicted about PEP. Conclusions: The results suggest that: (1) SADs rarely obtain the benefits from PEP that they expect; (2) their positive metacognitive beliefs are maintained by solutions they sometimes find during PEP; and (3) SADs choose to perform PEP while feeling conflicted; while PEP ironically maintains and exacerbates negative self-beliefs/images, it is the only safe and useful way to improve their social performance. These findings support and expand on the theories of PEP.

TI Sunrise: A real-time event-processing system
SO BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL
DT Article
AB Conceived at Bell Labs, Sunrise is a high-throughput, real-time event-processing and aggregation system. It offers many of the data-management features of a conventional database system such as high-level, declarative programming interfaces and the traditional atomicity consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) correctness guarantees for transactions. Adapted to meet the needs of high-performance applications, Sunrise maintains its high throughput by using a shared-nothing parallel architecture that can deliver close to linear scale-up in practice. Sunrise achieves the real-time responsiveness (on the order of as little as a few milliseconds per transaction) that many emerging applications require by relying on the DataBlitz(TM) main-memory database system as its underlying single-site storage manager. The DataBlitz storage manager guarantees the fast access to correct data expected from a database system. The strength of Sunrise lies not only in ifs performance, but also in its flexibility. This paper introduces Sunrise and its two major components: a real-time analysis engine (RAE), at the heart of the runtime system and a service authoring environment (SAE), which is the Sunrise authoring interface.

AB In this paper, we address the multi robot coordination problem of tightly-coupled task execution, using a formal decentralized supervisory control approach. A general architecture for decentralized supervisory control of Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems (FDES), which is capable of modeling asynchronous event driven systems with inherited uncertainties, is developed. This architecture is then incorporated for controlling behavior-based mobile robots moving in unstructured environments while maintaining a fixed distance between each other, which resembles a tightly-coupled multi robot object manipulation task. The proposed approach is then successfully implemented in simulation with two mobile robots and a performance evaluation is also performed to investigate the validity of the proposed approach over the centralized and crisp Discrete Event System (DES) based approaches.

ID PATTERN QUERIES
AB Efficient matching of incoming events of data streams to persistent queries is fundamental to event stream processing systems in wireless sensor networks. These applications require dealing with high volume and continuous data streams with fast processing time on distributed complex event processing (CEP) systems. Therefore, a well-managed parallel processing technique is needed for improving the performance of the system. However, the specific properties of pattern operators in the CEP systems increase the difficulties of the parallel processing problem. To address these issues, a parallelization model and an adaptive parallel processing strategy are proposed for the complex event processing by introducing a histogram and utilizing the probability and queue theory. The proposed strategy can estimate the optimal event splitting policy, which can suit the most recent workload conditions such that the selected policy has the least expected waiting time for further processing of the arriving events. The proposed strategy can keep the CEP system running fast under the variation of the time window sizes of operators and the input rates of streams. Finally, the utility of our work is demonstrated through the experiments on the StreamBase system.

AB The customer satisfaction of the broadband network mostly depends on robustness of the service offered by Internet Service Providers (ISP). Providing uninterrupted network service is essential in this communication era even though interruption in internet connection is unavoidable. However, if it is predicted earlier, the consequences can be minimized. Hence, it is essential to accurately forecast the faults in internet connection for Telecom Companies. The proposed tool for predicting broadband network fault is made up of a combination of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Predictive Analytics (PA) techniques. The PA is used to predict network faults using techniques such as Logistic Regression (LR) or Naive Bayes (NB). CEP is used to perform the prediction in real-time on streaming events. In this paper the performance of predictive model configured with LR is compared with the one configured with NB. Both the models had been tested for its performance using appropriate data set received from telecommunication industry using precision-recall curve and accuracy. It was found that the prediction accuracy of LR model (89.65%) is better than that of NB model (86.25%). It was also noticed that the derived AUC of LR is 0.52 which is much higher than 0.21 of NB. Hence, it was concluded that the predictive model configured with LR is performing better than the one configured with NB. So, the proposed tool configured with LR model can be implemented for fault prediction in network management systems.

   Explainable reinforcement learning; Event-driven monitoring
AB Modern software systems are increasingly expected to show higher degrees of autonomy and self-management to cope with uncertain and diverse situations. As a consequence, autonomous systems can exhibit unexpected and surprising behaviours. This is exacerbated due to the ubiquity and complexity of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems. This is the case of Reinforcement Learning (RL), where autonomous agents learn through trial-and-error how to find good solutions to a problem. Thus, the underlying decision-making criteria may become opaque to users that interact with the system and who may require explanations about the system's reasoning. Available work for eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) offers different trade-offs: e.g. for runtime explanations, the approaches are model-specific or can only analyse results after-the-fact. Different from these approaches, this paper aims to provide an online model-agnostic approach for XRL towards trustworthy and understandable AI. We present ETeMoX, an architecture based on temporal models to keep track of the decision-making processes of RL systems. In cases where the resources are limited (e.g. storage capacity or time to response), the architecture also integrates complex event processing, an event-driven approach, for detecting matches to event patterns that need to be stored, instead of keeping the entire history. The approach is applied to a mobile communications case study that uses RL for its decision-making. In order to test the generalisability of our approach, three variants of the underlying RL algorithms are used: Q-Learning, SARSA and DQN. The encouraging results show that using the proposed configurable architecture, RL developers are able to obtain explanations about the evolution of a metric, relationships between metrics, and were able to track situations of interest happening over time windows.

AB A new optimistic synchronization algorithm for Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) called SafeBTW is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm eliminates risky event processing in the Time Warp processing stage of the original BTW algorithm and is founded on a concept called "safe causal relation". In our new algorithm, the length of any chained rollback operations is limited to at most one and cascading rollback effects found in the original BTW algorithm can be completely avoided. Performance tests of Time Warp, Breathing Time Bucket, Breathing Time Warp and the new SafeBTW algorithms using PHOLD model show that the new algorithm obtains better speedups as the computation scales up. Its effective event processing time as a percentage of the total event processing time is higher than that of Time Warp and Breathing Time Warp, proving that excessive rollback operations are successfully controlled. And the extra synchronization overhead it introduces is still much lower than that of Breathing Time Bucket itself and is within tolerable and stable level as the computation scales up.

AB The study investigated the relationship between self-focused attention (SFA) and post-event processing (PEP) in social anxiety. SFA is the process of directing attention to internal stimuli during a social interaction. PEP is a detailed review of performance following an interaction. Highly socially anxious students (N = 82) were randomly assigned to a high SFA (n = 40) or low SFA condition (n = 42) and completed baseline measures of social anxiety, depression, trait SFA, and trait rumination. After SFA was manipulated via instructions, participants engaged in a 5-min unstructured conversation with a confederate, followed by a manipulation check. PEP was assessed the next day online. The high SFA group reported a similar amount of positive PEP but more frequent negative PEP over the 24-h period compared to the low SFA group. These results provide support for a causal relationship between SFA and PEP and have important applications for the development of effective cognitive-behavioural interventions.

AB Data interoperability implies data exchanges among intra and inter enterprises collaborating with information systems (IS). The multiplicity of these exchanges and the increasing number of data exchanged generates complexity and brings out the needs for control to avoid dysfunctions with a negative impact on the overall performance of the systems. Indeed, actually, interoperability has become a necessary performance lever that thus requires particular attention. Being at a low level in the enterprise interoperability concerns, data interoperability is mainly automated, which leads us to question: Is it possible to evaluate data interoperability performance and security based on inspection and analysis of ongoing data exchanges? We therefore endeavored to answer this question by establishing monitoring and analysis systems. In this paper, we present a research work which addresses services provided by a messaging-based communication system. In order to collect information on Information System interactions allowing one to assess their level of data interoperability, we propose a messaging metamodel that aggregates the collected information. It provides a single point of control and enables one to determine indicators of potential interoperability problems. The approach is validated on two case studies. An industrial case study of interactions among existing systems is presented to showcase the feasibility and interest of the approach. It is proposed on top of RabbitMQ and allows our partner to identify some issues in the studied information system. The second case study shows that the approach can integrate other protocols, by reading MQTT messages. The approach is implemented using Moose, a software analysis platform.

AB Soft real-time systems sometimes operate under Uncertain and unpredictable environmental conditions which makes event arrival times unreliable and variable. Input to such systems also change from time to time making event processing times variable. Due to such variations, traditional techniques using worst case times to estimate system performance deviate far from actual expected behavior This paper presents a Method of Stages based Analysis of soft Real Time systems (MoSART). MoSART takes into account variance in both the arrival and execution time and can model the performance of different scheduling algorithms. Sensitivity analysis, experimental validation, and the discovery of state dependent algorithms that outperform popular algorithms are demonstrated.

AB In the recent years, there is a massive surge in real-time data owing to the growing number of distributed software applications that continuously generates a large volume of data streams. These applications utilize new hardware technologies and data collection methods that inherently produce uncertain data. The Complex event processing (CEP) is a crucial software technology that manages highly dynamic event streams in a timely manner and determines the event patterns of interest. The CEP processes the massive data streams from different applications that depend on the reliability of data to produce accurate results. The business intelligence requires high-level of knowledge extracted from continuous streams. Ignoring uncertainty in event processing significantly degrades the performance and accuracy. Thus, efficient processing of uncertain data is vital to improving the efficiency and the accuracy of the CEP results for better decision making in business. This survey discusses the basics of uncertainty, explores models and query processing methods to deal with uncertainty. The primary contribution of this work is the survey of CEP regarding event query language and event query processing involved in identifying the complex event patterns over uncertain events. The challenges and the future directions for handling uncertain events in CEP are discussed in detail.

AB Streaming databases and other distributed, event-based systems are very useful tools for business and security applications. When event sources and event processing are distributed across multiple distinct domains, confidentiality and privacy issues emerge. These can be addressed by a number of cryptographic techniques. In this paper we consider high-performance symmetric encryption techniques. We build a system for privacy-preserving event correlation and evaluate the performance of the its techniques. We demonstrate efficient privacy-preserving event correlation using equality tests, greater-than comparisons and range queries. The results indicate that in comparable settings, it is therefore recommended to employ these techniques to address pertinent security and privacy concerns.

AB Existing Grid monitoring approaches do not combine three desirable features: on-line access to monitoring data, advanced query capabilities and data reduction. We present a solution for on-line monitoring of large-scale computing infrastructures based on Complex Event Processing principles and technologies. We focus on leveraging CEP for distributed processing of client queries and monitoring data streams. This results in significant reduction of network traffic due to on-line monitoring. We discuss benefits of CEP-based approach to monitoring and describe details of processing queries in a distributed way. A case study monitoring of load caused by jobs in a Grid infrastructure is presented. Performance evaluation to investigate monitoring overhead in terms of CPU, memory and network traffic is also provided.

DE Distributed automation systems; distributed control; distributed time
   synchronization; IEC 61499; IEEE 1588
AB Time-driven and event-driven control models are two fundamental design paradigms applied in distributed control systems for synchronizing decentralized activities. This paper proposes a unified architecture for combining both approaches. The combination offers the best of both worlds' properties, such as the expressiveness of event-driven programming and the determinism of time-driven logic. The foundations of this symbiosis are the IEC 61499 Function Block standard providing event-driven distributed control architecture and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol establishing the basis for highly-accurate time synchronization. The proposed time-complemented event-driven distributed control model aims at improving the modularity and flexibility of automation software with satisfactory control performance. The new control model has been compared with conventional centralized and distributed control approaches analytically and by simulation. The comparison results reveal that the proposed control model is efficient and flexible. Finally, a reference example has been used to demonstrate merits of the new approach.

AB Traditional commercial and retail banks are under great pressure from new competitors. They must rise to the challenges of understanding their customer actions and behaviors, and be ready to meet their expectations even before they explicitly express them. But the ability to know customers' demands in nearly real-time requires the evolution of existing architectures to support the detection, notification, and processing of business events to manage business information streams. This paper describes a practical experience in evolving a core banking enterprise architecture by leveraging business event exploitation, and includes the definition of business events; the design of a reference architecture and its integration points with the legacy architecture, as well as the description of an initial governance approach. Furthermore, as the core banking architecture is a critical infrastructure we have evaluated the performance of the evolved architecture so as to understand whether or not it can meet the banks' quality levels.

AB Phenomena clouds are characterized by nondeterministic, dynamic variations of shapes, sizes, direction, and speed of motion along multiple axes. The phenomena detection and tracking should not be limited to some traditional applications such as oil spills and gas clouds but also be utilized to more accurately observe other types of phenomena such as walking motion of people. This wider range of applications requires more reliable, in-situ techniques that can accurately adapt to the dynamics of phenomena. Unfortunately, existing works which only focus on simple and well-defined shapes of phenomena are no longer sufficient.
   In this article, we present a new class of applications together with several distributed algorithms to detect and track phenomena clouds, regardless of their shapes and movement direction. We first propose a distributed algorithm for in-situ detection and tracking of phenomena clouds in a sensor space. We next provide a mathematical model to optimize the energy consumption, on which we further propose a localized algorithm to minimize the resource utilization. Our proposed approaches not only ensure low processing and networking overhead at the centralized query processor but also minimize the number of sensors which are actively involved in the detection and tracking processes. We validate our approach using both real-life smart home applications and simulation experiments, which confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. We also show that our algorithms result in significant reduction in resource usage and power consumption as compared to contemporary stream-based approaches.

AB Research institutes and companies are focusing intensively on Complex Event Processing, Event Stream Processing, Information Flow Processing and Surprise Event Detection methods and algorithms. This phenomenon is intensified by the rapid evolution and spreading in practice of the Internet of Things services. A huge amount of data is created continuously by the physical and logical sensors embedded into various equipment and aimed to monitor the state of physical processes. Time critical query-response mechanisms of the QoS based systems are more and more penetrating in the low bandwidth wireless sensor environment, as well. The behavior of the wireless sensor network requires special evaluation of the state information sent to and processed by the sink node. The items of the status information flow are affected by the low energy and low bandwidth characteristics of sensor networks. Despite of uncertainty of the data transmission in wireless sensor networks the energy constraint permits rarely retransmission of data affected by error. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, cognitive infocommunication algorithms may prove to be an effective solutions. Consequently, this paper presents a method to detect special events and surprises in time processes of the sensor network communication. The proposed method is applied to ZigBee sensor network (based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard) in different congestion scenarios.

AB The design and performance of the third level trigger of the L3 experiment at LEP are described. The implementation is based on a 3081/E emulator farm interfaced to the Fastbus data acquisition system and on software algorithms for event processing written in FORTRAN. The system, used for background rejection and event tagging, also provides online monitoring of the detector status and the data quality.

TI Managing Measurement and Occurrence Uncertainty in Complex Event

ID DECISION-MAKING; MODEL
AB Complex event processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of real-time events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. In many situations, these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This paper presents a proposal for incorporating and managing different kinds of uncertainty that may happen in both events and rules of the CEP systems. We provide a library that enables the representation and propagation of uncertain values, which can be efficiently integrated with the existing CEP languages and engines to deal with uncertainty, and we show how the treatment of uncertainty can be smoothly added to two of them: Esper and Apache Flink. Five applications coming from various domains serve to evaluate the proposal and to analyze its performance and accuracy. The results show that the overhead introduced by the treatment of uncertainty is not high and good precision and recall are achieved.

AB Marlin is the event processing framework of the iLCSoft [1] ecosystem. Originally developed for the ILC more than 15 years ago, it is now widely used also by other communities, such as CLICdp, CEPC and many test beam projects such as CALICE, LCTPC and EU-Telescope. While Marlin is lightweight and flexible it was originally designed for sequential processing only. With MarlinMT we have now evolved Marlin for parallel processing of events on multi-core architectures based on multi-threading. We report on the necessary developments and issues encountered, within Marlin as well as with the underlying LCIO [4] event data model (EDM). A focus will be put on the new parallel event processing (PEP) scheduler. We conclude with first performance estimates, like the application speedup and a discussion on histogram handling in parallel applications.

AB High performance computing facilities present unique challenges and opportunities for HEP event processing. The massive scale of many HPC systems means that fractionally small utilization can yield large returns in processing throughput. Parallel applications which can dynamically and efficiently fill any scheduling opportunities the resource presents benefit both the facility (maximal utilization) and the (compute-limited) science. The ATLAS Yoda system provides this capability to HEP-like event processing applications by implementing event-level processing in an MPI-based master-client model that integrates seamlessly with the more broadly scoped ATLAS Event Service. Fine grained, event level work assignments are intelligently dispatched to parallel workers to sustain full utilization on all cores, with outputs streamed off to destination object stores in near real time with similarly fine granularity, such that processing can proceed until termination with full utilization. The system offers the efficiency and scheduling flexibility of preemption without requiring the application actually support or employ check-pointing. We will present the new Yoda system, its motivations, architecture, implementation, and applications in ATLAS data processing at several US HPC centers.

AB Excessive post-mortem processing after social situations, a core symptom of social anxiety disorder (SAD), is thought to contribute to the perpetuation of social anxiety by consolidating negative self schemata. Empirical findings on actual mechanisms underlying this so-called Post-Event Processing (PEP) are still scarce. The present study sought to identify variables associated with the experience of PEP after real-life social situations in a sample of 49 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Using an ambulatory assessment approach, individuals were asked to report on each distressing social event experienced during one week. A total of 192 events were captured. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that next to trait social anxiety, the type of social situation (performance vs. interaction situations), self-focused attention, safety behavior use, and negative affect predicted levels of PEP after social situations. These findings add to the growing literature that emphasizes the importance of situational factors for the experience of PEP, and highlight potential venues to prevent it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated whether positive feedback from same-age peers can modify self-relevant cognitive processes of high socially anxious youth in a positive direction. Thirty-three high socially anxious and 32 non-socially anxious undergraduate students (17-22 years) gave an impromptu speech and received either positive or neutral feedback post-speech. Anticipatory processing (AP) was rated prior to the speech via self-report. One week later participants returned to the laboratory and completed questionnaires assessing post-event processing (PEP) thoughts related to the impromptu speech and AP about a future speech. For high socially anxious youth receiving positive feedback, AP about their speech performance significantly improved over time. In addition, high socially anxious participants who received positive feedback reported a higher frequency of positive PEP thoughts about their speech in the intervening week. These improvements did not occur in the neutral peer feedback condition. Non-socially anxious participants' AP improved in both feedback conditions, whereas their frequency of PEP was unaffected by feedback. These findings suggest that, in high socially anxious youth, positive feedback from same-age peers can modify self-relevant cognitive processes in a positive direction. We discuss how methodological improvements could more thoroughly investigate the potential of positive peer feedback for changing cognitions.

AB Rising energy prices, increasing fierce competition, new environmental legislation and concerns over climate change are forcing energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises to increase production energy efficiency and reduce their associated environmental impacts. Thanks to the rapid developments of technologies in Internet of Things (IoT), the real-time status of resources and the data of energy consumption from manufacturing processes can be collected easily. These manufacturing information can provide an opportunity to enhance the energy efficiency in real-time production management. To achieve this target, this work presents a real-time energy efficiency optimisation method (REEOM) for energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises. By this method, IoT technologies are applied to sense the real-time primitive production data, including the energy consumption data and the resources status data. Multilevel event model and complex event processing are used to obtain real-time energy-related key performance indicators (e-KPIs) which extend production performance indicators to the energy efficiency area. Then, the non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm II is used to schedule or reschedule the production plan in an energy-efficient way based on real-time e-KPIs. Finally, a case is used to demonstrate the presented REEOM.

AB The ATLAS trigger successfully collected collision data during the first run of the LHC between 2009-2013 at different centre-of-mass energies between 900 GeV and 8 TeV. The trigger system consists of a hardware Level-1 and a software-based high level trigger (HLT) that reduces the event rate from the design bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of a few hundred Hz. In Run-2, the LHC will operate at centre-of-mass energies of 13 and 14 TeV and higher luminosity, resulting in up to five times higher rates of processes of interest. A brief review of the ATLAS trigger system upgrades that were implemented between Run-1 and Run-2, allowing to cope with the increased trigger rates while maintaining or even improving the efficiency to select physics processes of interest, will be given. This includes changes to the Level-1 calorimeter and muon trigger systems, the introduction of a new Level-1 topological trigger module and the merging of the previously two-level HLT system into a single event processing farm. A few examples will be shown, such as the impressive performance improvements in the HLT trigger algorithms used to identify leptons, hadrons and global event quantities like missing transverse energy. Finally, the status of the commissioning of the trigger system and its performance during the 2015 run will be presented.

AB Current digital hardware implementations of spiking neural networks usually focus on a time-driven architecture to process the large number of events that occur during a typical simulation. While this type of implementation is practical for simulating biologically accurate neurons, most systems using a simpler neuron model can benefit from an event-driven architecture. In such cases, significant performance improvements are theoretically possible. In practice, however, such implementations do not maximize the available computational power because finding the next event often involves serializing computations. In this paper, a hardware architecture that offers the efficiency of an event-driven algorithm while allowing parallel computations is developed. The architecture uses multiple pipelined processing elements to compute spikes in parallel and a novel comparator tree structure to find the next event in a large network efficiently. The resulting system can implement up to 131 072 neurons on a single FPGA (Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T) and processes approximately 70 million spikes per second when using a 4-bank architecture clocked at 100 MHz.

AB The express delivery industry of China is relatively backward in the automation degree of critical business processes. The basic reason is that the business-related supporting data, which is scattered in the multidimensional space, is difficult to utilize and process. This paper proposes an automatic data acquisition framework to resolve such difficulty, which synthetically utilize intelligent inernet of things (IoT), semantic web and complext event processing(CEP) technology. We also implement a SCEP prototype system with the capability of real-time detecting complex business events on the goods sorting line, which adopts a detection method consisting of four stages. The simulation results show that the system has good performance and feasible enough to deal with the complex business which need data support from multidimensional space.

AB Recent advancements in sensor technology offer opportunities to manage business processes in a proactive manner. To enable an effective and real-time monitoring, sensor data have to be treated and processed in an event processing manner. Complex Event Processing is an efficient technology that detects useful complex events by matching primitive sensor events using event patterns. Event patterns can be represented as templates that combine primitive events by temporal, logical, spatial and sequential correlations to detect more complex events. Identifying event patterns out of streaming data with a high data volume and velocity is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an Ensemble Model consisting of a crisp and fuzzy rule based classifiers in order to derive decision rules as event patterns. Before implementing the ensemble classifier directly to the streaming data, we select the most influential feature subset using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using real data obtained from accelerometer sensors. Promising results with high accuracy and appropriate level of computational complexity were obtained and discussed.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a novel and promising methodology that enables the real-time analysis of stream event data. The main purpose of CEP is detection of the complex event patterns from the atomic and semantically low-level events such as sensor, log, or RFID data. Determination of the rule patterns for matching these simple events based on the temporal, semantic, or spatial correlations is the central task of CEP systems. In the current design of the CEP systems, experts provide event rule patterns. Having reached maturity, the Big Data Systems and Internet of Things (IoT) technology require the implementation of advanced machine learning approaches for automation in the CEP domain. The goal of this research is proposing a machine learning model to replace the manual identification of rule patterns. After a pre-processing stage (dealing with missing values, data outliers, etc.), various rule-based machine learning approaches were applied to detect complex events. Promising results with high preciseness were obtained. A comparative analysis of the performance of classifiers is discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The readout server (ROS), which constitutes the second level of the CMS drift tubes (DT) subdetector readout architecture, is a complex VME 9U board, currently placed in the CMS cavern, in the racks on one side of the detector wheels. The planned upgrade of DT electronics for 2013-2014 includes the relocation of all the second level of readout and trigger electronics in the CMS counting room, allowing among others, the future redesign of a higher performance ROS board based on commercial devices with no radiation tolerance requirements.
   Simulation studies have been carried out in order to assess the system's performance under the increased luminosity (10(35) cm(-2) S-1) planned for the HL-LHC upgrade, ca. 2020. Results show that the ROS board could become a limiting factor due to the event processing time.
   The capabilities of currently-available FPGAs allow incorporating most of the ROS functions (input deserialization, input buffer, data processing and multiplexing, slow control interface, test-mode operation) into a single device. In particular, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 series are being considered. In both families, fully-automatic asynchronous deserialization is carried out by the gigabit transceivers, which are not suitable for our application due to the minimum data rate and reduced availability. Nevertheless, asynchronous data reception can be carried out by making use of the dedicated deserializers present in each of the 110 tiles, plus some additional logic and clocking resources.
   The improved performance of these devices (as compared with current ROS technology) allows reducing the event processing time, increasing maximum system's operation frequency.

AB Socially anxious college students are at increased risk for engaging in problematic drinking (i.e. heavy or risky drinking) behaviors that are associated with the development of an alcohol use disorder. The present study examined whether post-event processing (PEP), repeatedly thinking about and evaluating one's performance in a past social situation, strengthens the association between social anxiety and vulnerability to problematic drinking among college students. Eighty-three college drinkers with high or low social anxiety participated in a social interaction task and were exposed to a manipulation that either promoted or inhibited PEP about the social interaction. Among participants randomized to the PEP promotion condition, those with high social anxiety exhibited a greater urge to use alcohol after the social interaction and greater motivation to drink to cope with depressive symptoms over the week following the manipulation than did those with low social anxiety. These findings suggest that targeting PEP in college drinking intervention programs may improve the efficacy of such programs for socially anxious students.

AB Current social phobia models (e.g., Clark & Wells, 1995; Leary & Kowalski, 1995) postulate that socially anxious individuals negatively appraise their anxiety sensations (e.g., sweating, heart racing, blushing) as evidence of poor social performance, and thus fear these anxiety symptoms will be noticed and judged negatively by others. Consequently, they become self-focused and hypervigilant of these sensations and use them to judge how they appear to others. To test this model, high (N=41) and low (N=38) socially anxious participants were shown false physiological feedback regarding an increase or decrease in heart rate prior to and during an impromptu speech task. Relative to participants who observed a false heart rate decrease, those in the increase condition reported higher levels of negative affect, more negative performance appraisals, and more frequent negative ruminative thoughts, and these effects were mediated by an increase in self-focused attention. The unhelpful effects of the physiological feedback were not specific to high socially anxious participants. The results have implications for current cognitive models as well as the treatment of social phobia.

DE HMI embedded programming; rapid development; Low-Code Development;
   Service Orchestration
AB With the development of IoT(Internet of Things) technology, the number of IoT applications which involve embedded screen-type HMI is increasing rapidly. The development of embedded HMI programming needs to go through the procedure of UI programming, embedded programming, back-end programming, etc. Because of the long development chain and the high requirements for developers, embedded HMI programming has not only the weakness of high expenditure and long development period, but also the pain point of long iteration and difficulty in later upgrading. This paper designs and implements an embedded HMI zero code system, including screen driver module, screen event processing module, format conversion module and MQTT link module on the embedded side; micro-service router module, various microservices, format conversion module and MQTT link module on the background server side. This system achieves the goal of zero code on embedded end by the means of using screen drive module to migrate the embedded HMI FSM to background server; screen event processing module to realize the display of HMI data controls. The micro-service router transmits the HMI events to each microservice through the micro-service router module, which uses 1-to-1 mapping mode between events and microservices, and the mapping relationship is stored in the relational database. To discriminate different HMI terminals, K/V database is used to store business process number and business intermediate data, which are differentiated through different tags. Experiment results are consistent with system design, The HMI interaction average delay time is 3ms after passing through the screen event module and screen drive module, which is at the same level as traditional embedded HMI applications; by passing the zero code middleware, the embedded end code is reduced to zero, the back-end code is increased by about 10%, and the overall development time is reduced by 30%. The practice of intelligent manufacturing digital factory indicates that zero code is realized at the embedded HMI end, the back-end code is only increased by 10%, and the overall development cycle is shortened by 30%; The practice of smart home shows that zero code is realized at the embedded HMI end, the back-end code is only increased by 5%, and the overall development cycle is shortened by 20%.

AB Background: Present day control and monitoring systems are equipped with a large number of heterogeneous devices and are operated by many users with different roles and responsibilities. The information generated by these devices, although preprocessed and filtered, is usually delivered to users regardless of their actual information needs, thus overwhelming cognitive capacities and potentially affecting safety of the system.
   Objectives: This work aims to reduce information load to the users of the data-intensive monitoring systems by delivering selected information to each user based on his/her roles in the system and responsibilities.
   Methods: The proposed approach combines Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for configuration purposes and run-time analyzing. The approach is exemplified with implemented tools and feasibility study based on the performance tests. The paper describes principles of proposed approach, demonstrates illustrative scenarios from building automation domain, gives description of implemented tools, and presents results of the initial performance tests.
   Results: The combination of SW and CEP brings two major advantages: (1) the behavior of the system could be easily changed by configuring only underlying ontology and (2) utilization of CEP at runtime makes system event-driven and reactive to frequent changes in the environment. The performance tests demonstrated the response time of implemented tools within one second for 1000 updates per second (which corresponded to 10,000 devices in the performed experiments).
   Conclusions: It is expected that the proposed approach is able to make monitoring systems personal oriented and thus safer during the operation. The results of the performance tests suggest feasibility of the approach for such systems as building and home automation, and non-critical industrial automation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper presents a computational system based on a synchronous feedback neural network for the on-line event processing of a photon counting intensified CCD. The project is based on a neuron model that improves the one already defined for the SIgnal REcognition Network (SIREN) system and on a suitable network architecture. As far as the neuron is concerned, a new equation for network dynamics is envisaged, that allows to reduce the number of cycles needed for event identification. As far as the architecture is concerned, we focus on the definition of a network having less neurons than SIREN while maintaining the same performance. An hypothesis of network architecture and a performance comparison between the two neural models are given in the paper.

AB In order to achieve optimal results, an agent's way of decision making might need to change according to the circumstances. One of the aspects an agent can adapt is the way it processes external events. Therewith it controls to what extend it is being influenced by external factors. We argue that influence control is a form of metareasoning. In this paper, we propose a model for metareasoning that allows the agent to select and prioritize heuristics for event processing. The model includes a performance measure based on goal achievement, a selection mechanism to select desired attitude and a control mechanism to adapt its attitude. We describe how to specify these components and we discuss the agent's performance in a scenario involving coordination.

AB Detecting early enough the anomalous behavior of technical systems facilitates cost savings thanks to avoiding system downtimes, guiding maintenance, or improving performance. The novel framework proposed in this paper processes event streams originating from system monitoring for anomaly detection purposes. Therefore, statistical models characterizing the normal behavior of the monitored system are learned from the events. Instead of having one coarse normal model for all operational states, the proposed framework contains a mechanism for automatically detecting different conditions of the systemallowing for fine-tuned models for every condition. The performance of the framework is demonstrated by means of a real-world application, where the log files of a large-scale printing machine are analyzed for anomalies.

Several applications can benefit from recording the physical places a mobile entity visits and how long it stays at each position. This paper discusses the need for an Available, Reliable, Transparent, Immutable, and Irrevocable service for Mobility Records (ARTIIMoR). We present an approach to recording spatio-temporal presence information in a reliable, immutable, and scalable way using a multilayer Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) architecture for storing location information in variable levels of abstraction and aggregation. We implemented this multilayer solution as a middleware service that uses Complex Event Processing on smartphones to efficiently record nearby place-specific beacons in a DLT. We compare the performance of inserting data in the IOTA, Ethereum, and Hyperledger DLTs, the impact that different data aggregation techniques have on insertion performance, and the effect of the multilayer approach on data query performance.

AB Monitoring of Service Level Agreements is a crucial phase of SLA management. In the most challenging case, monitoring of SLA fulfillment is required in (near) real-time and needs to combine performance data regarding multiple distributed services and resources. Currently existing Grid monitoring and information services do not provide adequate on-line monitoring capabilities to fulfill this case. We present an application of Complex Event Processing principles and technologies for on-line SLA monitoring in the Grid. The capabilities of the presented SLA monitoring framework include (1) on-demand definition of SLA metrics using a high-level query language; (2) real-time calculation of the defined SLA metrics; (3) advanced query capabilities which allow for defining high-level complex metrics derived from basic metrics. SLA monitoring of data-intensive grid jobs serves as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach.

AB The existing Remote Health Monitoring System (RHMS) is not fast enough to detect the abnormality as it uses batch processing to detect abnormality in the vital parameters of the patient and it doesn't scale well. CEP uses event driven approach and correlates different sensor streams with spatiotemporal constraints for abnormality detection. This paper proposes a CEP based Remote Health Monitoring System named (CRHMS). The proposed CRHMS uses Biosensors (Heart rate, Respiration Rate, Blood Pressure and ECG) to collect the vital parameters and environmental sensors (Accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS)) for context identification of the elderly patient who is home alone. These sensor parameters are collected on android phone and sent as a stream to the proposed system to identify the abnormalities in vital signs and generate alert. The proposed system has been implemented using Drools Fusion engine and validated for several patients. The performance of the proposed CRHMS is compared with existing batch processing system. It is found that the proposed system has improvement over Batch Processing System in terms of Event processing time. Also, the developed system is made adaptive by providing dynamic learning support using hot rule addition.

AB The system level hardware architecture of individual nodes in a wireless distributed sensor network has not received adequate attention. A large portion of the development work in wireless sensor networks has been devoted to the networking layer or the network communications, but considering the tight integration required between the hardware and software on each node can result in major benefits in power, performance, and usability as well. A novel hardware architecture based on the concept of task specific modular computing provides both the high flexibility and power efficiency required for effective distributed sensing solutions. A comparative power analysis with a traditional, centralized architecture gives a justifying motivation for pursuing the modular architecture.(1) Finally, three decentralized module self-control mechanisms developed to minimize total system power will be presented and explained in detail.

TI A FRAMEWORK FOR DYNAMIC PROGRAM ANALYZERS
SO SIGPLAN NOTICES
DT Article
AB BEE++ is an object-oriented application framework for the dynamic analysis of distributed programs. The main objective of BEE++ is to provide a common platform for monitoring and debugging. BEE++'s class library consists of a rich set of classes for event processing to support a variety of visualization, monitoring and debugging needs. It also provides for customizability of event processing through inheritance. Users can derive customized graphical debugging and visualization systems from a set of base classes. BEE++'s other design goals are the support of dynamic program analysis for distributed heterogenous target applications at runtime with predictable overhead. The design is based a symmetric peer-peer architecture, including the ability to dynamically configure target applications and monitoring tools. The dynamic analysis tools can be distributed across nodes, which provides significant performance gains for visualization applications. In addition, the framework can be instantiated for a variety of communication protocols.A TCP/IP based instance of the framework has been ported to several machine architectures including Sun, Vax and Cray-YMP. BEE++ is based on BEE[10], a portable platform for monitoring implemented in C but has been completely reengineered in C++ using the object-oriented design methodology OMT. Performance measurements indicate that the runtime overhead of the object-oriented version is not significant when compared with the C version.

AB In this day and age, there exists an increasing need for systems and architectures able to process spatio-temporal data in a timely way. As a result, this paper presents CEP-traj, a novel middleware to ease the development of real-time trajectory-based services based on the Complex Event Processing (CEP) paradigm. By means of an event-based approach, the present middleware is able to detect a set of generic patterns along with meaningful changes of an entity's movement. In order to prove its suitability and feasibility, a vessel abnormal-behaviour detection system has been developed on the basis of the middleware's features. Finally, both synthetic and real datasets have been used to test the accuracy and performance of the middleware and the detection system implemented on top of the Esper engine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB PET detectors based on continuous crystal could be an ideal alternative for current high resolution pixelated PET detectors if the issues of high performance position estimation and its real-time implementation are solved. Unfortunately, current existing position estimators are not much feasible for implementation on FPGA. In this paper, we propose a new self-organizing map (SOM) neural network based positioning scheme aiming at not only providing a high performance, but also being realistic for FPGA implementation. Benefitting from SOM feature mapping mechanism, the large set of input reference event data is approximated by a smaller set of prototype, which makes it easier to find the best pattern match for unknown events. Using our experimental data, the scheme is evaluated and compared with others. The test results show that SOM scheme has an equivalent positioning performance with previous k-NN method, and it is realistic to be implemented on FPGA achieving a high event processing throughput.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has posed new requirements to the underlying processing architecture, specially for real-time applications, such as event-detection services. Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines provide a powerful tool to implement these services. Fog computing has raised as a solution to support IoT real-time applications, in contrast to the Cloud-based approach. This work is aimed at analysing a CEP-based Fog architecture for real-time IoT applications that uses a publish-subscribe protocol. A testbed has been developed with low-cost and local resources to verify the suitability of CEP-engines to low-cost computing resources. To assess performance we have analysed the effectiveness and cost of the proposal in terms of latency and resource usage, respectively. Results show that the fog computing architecture reduces event-detection latencies up to 35%, while the available computing resources are being used more efficiently, when compared to a Cloud deployment. Performance evaluation also identifies the communication between the CEP-engine and the final users as the most time consuming component of latency. Moreover, the latency analysis concludes that the time required by CEP-engine is related to the compute resources, but is nonlinear dependent of the number of things connected.

AB Seamless and faultless operational conditions of multi stakeholder Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are of high importance for today's societies on a global scale. Due to their population impact, attacks against their interconnected components can create serious damages and performance degradation which eventually can result in a societal crisis. Therefore it is crucial to effectively and timely protect these high performance - critical systems against any type of malicious cyber-physical intrusions. This can be realized by protecting CIs against threat consequences or by blocking threats to take place at an early stage and preventing further escalation or predicting threat occurrences and have the ability to rapidly react by eliminating its roots. In this paper a novel architecture is proposed in which these three ways of confronting with cyber - physical threats are combined using a novel semantics based risk methodology that relies on real time behavioral analysis. The final prototype provides the CI operator with a decision tool (DST) that imprints the proposed approach and which is capable of alerting on new unknown threats, generate suggestions of the required counter-actions and alert of probable threat existence. The implemented architecture has been tested and validated in a proof of concept scenario of an airport CI with simulated monitoring data.

AB The Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) Software is a central tool in the CMS experiment. Its robustness and flexibility is critical for monitoring detector performance and providing fast and comprehensive feedback centrally for the experiment in realtime (Online DQM), after a full event processing with fine-grained analysis (Offline DQM), and as a validation tool to validate both the CMS software (CMSSW), calibration and alignment scenarios and extensive simulations. The entire DQM framework has undergone fundamental changes, and the first performance results of this newly updated system will be presented in the context of the first proton-proton collisions for CERN's Large Hadron Collider at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. These results will encapsulate the performance of the CMS detector in the context of the upgraded DQM system that makes available more sophisticated methods for evaluating data quality, as well as a dedicated review of the technical challenges and improvements specific to the DQM framework itself.

AB As ever more computation shifts onto multicore architectures, it is increasingly critical to find effective ways of dealing with multithreaded performance bugs like true and false sharing. Previous approaches to fixing false sharing in unmanaged languages have employed highly-invasive runtime program modifications. We observe that managed language runtimes, with garbage collection and JIT code compilation, present unique opportunities to repair such bugs directly, mirroring the techniques used in manual repairs.
   We present REMIX, a modified version of the Oracle HotSpot JVM which can detect cache contention bugs and repair false sharing at runtime. REMIX's detection mechanism leverages recent performance counter improvements on Intel platforms, which allow for precise, unobtrusive monitoring of cache contention at the hardware level. REMIX can detect and repair known false sharing issues in the LMAX Disruptor high-performance inter-thread messaging library and the Spring Reactor event-processing framework, automatically providing 1.5-2x speedups over unoptimized code and matching the performance of hand-optimization. REMIX also finds a new false sharing bug in SPECjvm2008, and uncovers a true sharing bug in the HotSpot JVM that, when fixed, improves the performance of three NAS Parallel Benchmarks by 7-25x. REMIX incurs no statistically-significant performance overhead on other benchmarks that do not exhibit cache contention, making REMIX practical for always-on use.

TI Digital twin concepts for linking live sensor data with real-time models
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS AND SENSOR SYSTEMS
DT Article
ID QUALITY
AB For taking most advantage of live or real-time sensor measurements, data have to be processed by a single or even by a chain of models on the fly, in contrast to earlier offline simulation solutions. This requirement can be best met by concepts developed under the general term "digital twin" (DT). The step from the Internet of Things (IoT) to a full exploitation of DT solutions entails new challenges but also provides new features, which we discuss based on our example DT solution for remote monitoring of fruit during ocean transportation. A crucial challenge is the transformation of models into an updateable format, necessary to keep the physical object and its modelled representation in sync. A basic new feature of DTs is new software solutions for easy and flexible linking of different models through a streaming platform by implementing an event-driven architecture. We demonstrate a solution for controlling model execution during multiple life cycle phases of the fruit as physical object. An evaluation of response times showed that server performance is sufficient to handle more than 100 DT instances per second.

AB This paper introduces an example of real-time "big data" processing systems accelerated by field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which will open up a novel design field for digital circuit engineers. Contrary to the perception that software on commodity servers dominates such large-scale processing requirements, there are various chances for utilizing hardware for the acceleration. One of the most promising applications is complex event processing (CEP), which requires hardware-based acceleration due to it having to process massive amounts of data in real time. We propose a design flow for compiling software-oriented event language into highly parallelized and pipelined CEP circuits, which enables our system to achieve a strikingly high performance of 20 Gbps. A sophisticated mechanism for integrating archives of previously arrived data with streams of current events also makes the FPGA-accelerated processing system applicable to a wide range of realistic "big data" applications.

AB Business operations include decisions having impact on their success and performance. The digital world provides access to massive amount of data being relevant in decision making. After a decision, often succeeding activities are not immediately started or preparation activities are conducted. Meanwhile new information could be received which lead to a different decision output. Considering this can save organizations process cost or flow time. In this paper, we provide a concept to realize the re-evaluation of decisions based on event processing. We integrated a re-evaluation scope in business processes in which change of decision is still accepted and which dynamically subscribes to those events leading to new decision output. The concept is evaluated by a proof-of concept implementation and a single-case experiment on a logistic use case. There, re-evaluation was relevant for almost a quarter of the transports reducing the traveling time.

AB To extract useful and actionable information in real-time, the information technology (IT) world is coping with big data problems today. In this paper, we present implementation details and performance results of ReCEPtor, our system for "online" Association Rule Mining (ARM) over big and fast data streams. Specifically, we added Apriori and two different FP-Growth algorithms inside Esper Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine and compared their performances using LastFM social music site data. Our most important findings show that online ARM can generate (1) more unique rules, (2) with higher throughput, and (3) much sooner (lower latency) than offline rule mining. In addition, we have found many interesting and realistic musical preference rules such as "George Harrison -> Beatles". We demonstrate a sustained rate of similar to 15K rows/sec per core. We hope that our findings can shed light on the design and

TI Quantitative analysis of UML statechart models of dependable systems
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
DT Article
AB The paper introduces a method which allows quantitative dependability analysis of systems modeled by using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) statechart diagrams. The analysis is performed by transforming the UML model to stochastic reward nets (SRNs). A large subset of statechart model elements is supported including event processing, state hierarchy and transition priorities. The transformation is presented by a set of SRN patterns. Performance-related measures can be directly derived using SRN tools, while dependability analysis requires explicit modeling of erroneous states and faulty behavior.

AB Quantum microscopy requires efficient detectors able to identify temporal correlations among photons. Photon coincidences are usually detected by postprocessing their timestamps measured by means of time-to-digital converters (TDCs), through a time and power-consuming procedure, which impairs the overall system performance. In this article, we propose an innovative single-photon sensitive imager based on single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), able to signal coincident photon pairs along with their position through a TDC-free, event-driven architecture. The result is a highly efficient detector (25.8%) with a 100% duty cycle and minimized data throughput. The modular architecture and the 330 ns readout time, independent of pixel number, pave the way to large format imagers based on the same paradigm. The detector enabled quantum imaging at extremely low, microwatt-level optical pump powers, four orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments with similar optical setups.

AB SAP Event Stream Processor (ESP) platform aims at delivering real-time stream processing and analytics in many time-critical areas such as Capital Markets, Internet of Things (IoT) and Data Center Intelligence. SAP ESP allows users to realize complex event processing (CEP) in the form of pattern queries. In this paper, we present MOTTO - a multi-query optimizer in SAP ESP in order to improve the performance of many concurrent pattern queries. This is motivated by the observations that many real-world applications usually have concurrent pattern queries working on the same data streams, leading to tremendous sharing opportunities among queries. In MOTTO, we leverage three major sharing techniques, namely merge, decomposition and operator transformation sharing, to reduce redundant computation among pattern queries. In addition, MOTTO supports nested pattern queries as well as pattern queries with different window sizes. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the MOTTO with real-world application scenarios and sensitivity studies.

AB Detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is a prominent figure of merit for imaging detectors, and its optimization is of fundamental importance for the efficient use of the experimental apparatus. In this work, I study the potential improvement offered by data processing on a single-event basis in a counting hybrid pixel electron detector (HPD). In particular, I introduce a simple and robust method of single-event processing based on the substitution of the original cluster of pixels with an isotropic Gaussian function. Key features are a better filtering of the noise power spectrum (NPS) and readily allowing for sub-pixel resolution. The performance of the proposed method is compared to other standard techniques such as centroiding and event normalization, in the simulated realistic scenario of 100 keV electrons impinging on a 450 mu m-thick silicon sensor with a pixel size of 75 mu m, yielding the best results. The DQE can potentially be enhanced over the entire spatial frequency range, increasing from 0.86 to nearly 1 at zero frequency and extending up to 1.40 times the physical Nyquist frequency of the system thanks to the sub-pixel resolution capability.

AB Existing literature suggests that anticipatory processing and post-event processing-two repetitive thinking processes linked to social anxiety disorder (SAD)-might be better conceptualized as facets of an underlying unidimensional repetitive thinking construct. The current study tested this by examining potential factor structures underlying anticipatory processing and post-event processing. Baseline data from two randomized controlled trials, consisting of 306 participants with SAD who completed anticipatory processing and post-event processing measures in relation to a speech task, were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. A bifactor model with a General Repetitive Thinking factor and two group factors corresponding to anticipatory processing and post-event processing best fit with the data. Further analyses indicated an optimal model would include only the General Repetitive Thinking factor (reflecting anticipatory processing and a specific aspect of post-event processing) and Post-event Processing group factor (reflecting another specific aspect of post-event processing that is separable), providing evidence against a unidimensional account of repetitive thinking in SAD. Analyses also indicated that the General Repetitive Thinking factor had moderately large associations with social anxiety and life interference (rs = .43 to .47), suggesting its maladaptive nature. The separable Post-event Processing group factor only had small associations with social anxiety (rs = .16 to .27) and was not related to life interference (r= .11), suggesting it may not, in itself, be a maladaptive process. Future research that further characterises the bifactor model components and tests their utility has the potential to improve the conceptualisation and assessment of repetitive thinking in SAD.

AB The increasing need for real-time insights in data sparked the development of multiple stream processing frameworks. Several benchmarking studies were conducted in an effort to form guidelines for identifying the most appropriate framework for a use case. In this article, we extend this research and present the results gathered. In addition to Spark Streaming and Flink, we also include the emerging frameworks Structured Streaming and Kafka Streams. We define four workloads with custom parameter tuning. Each of these is optimized for a certain metric or for measuring performance under specific scenarios such as bursty workloads. We analyze the relationship between latency, throughput, and resource consumption and we measure the performance impact of adding different common operations to the pipeline. To ensure correct latency measurements, we use a single Kafka broker. Our results show that the latency disadvantages of using a micro-batch system are most apparent for stateless operations. With more complex pipelines, customized implementations can give event-driven frameworks a large latency advantage. Due to its micro-batch architecture, Structured Streaming can handle very high throughput at the cost of high latency. Under tight latency SLAs, Flink sustains the highest throughput. Additionally, Flink shows the least performance degradation when confronted with periodic bursts of data. When a burst of data needs to be processed right after startup, however, micro-batch systems catch up faster while event-driven systems output the first events sooner.

AB Real-time data processing frameworks like S4 and Flume have become scalable and reliable solutions for acquiring, moving, and processing voluminous amounts of data continuously produced by large numbers of online sources. Yet these frameworks lack the elasticity to horizontally scale-up or scale-down their based on current rates of input events and desired event processing latencies. The Project Hoover middleware provides distributed methods for measuring, aggregating, and analyzing the performance of distributed Flume components, thereby enabling online configuration changes to meet varying processing demands. Experimental evaluations with a sample Flume data processing code show Hoover's approach to be capable of dynamically and continuously monitoring Flume performance, demonstrating that such data can be used to right-size the number of Flume collectors according to different log production rates.

AB The field of Complex Event Processing (CEP) deals with the techniques and tools developed to efficiently process pattern-based queries over data streams. The Semantic Web, through its standards and technologies, is in constant pursuit to provide solutions for such paradigm while employing the RDF data model. The integration of Semantic Web technologies in this context can handle the heterogeneity, integration and interpretation of data streams at the semantic level. In this paper, we propose and implement a new query language, called SPASEQ, that extends SPARQL with new Semantic Complex Event Processing (SCEP) operators that can be evaluated over RDF graph-based events. The novelties of SPASEQ include (i) the separation of general graph pattern matching constructs and temporal operators; (ii) the support for RDF graph-based events and multiple RDF graph streams; (iii) the expressibility of temporal operators such as Kleene+, conjunction, disjunction and event selection strategies; and (iv) the operators to integrate background information and streaming RDF graph streams. Hence, SPASEQ enjoys good expressiveness compared with the existing solutions. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of SPASEQ using a non-deterministic automata (NFA) model for an efficient evaluation of the SPASEQ queries. We provide the syntax and semantics of SPASEQ and based on this, we show how it can be implemented in an efficient manner. Moreover, we also present an experimental evaluation of its performance, showing that it improves over state-of-the-art approaches.

ID DESIGN
AB The early notification systems were designed using request-driven and later using the business process models. In the last ten years, the alert notification systems were developed using event centric modelling, but the design focus of these systems is mainly limited to the event producer or consumer driven approaches. Fewer or none of these models have focused on the event processing framework. Moreover, the existing notification systems have the following limitations: lack of functional separation between the event generation, processing and consuming layers, self-configuration, static computation of operational parameters, and lack of search capabilities of the computed parameters. This paper presents a generic architecture for an alert notification system based on the event processing framework. Further, we explain the detailed working of the system with the aid of the data flow, system, and functional architectural diagrams. The alert notification functionality is outlined with the help of the check algorithm.

AB Architectural patterns assist in the process of architectural decision making as they capture architectural aspects of proven solutions. In many cases, the chosen patterns have system-wide implications on non-functional requirements such as availability, performance, and resilience. Ensuring compliance with the selected patterns is of vital importance to avoid architectural drift between the implementation and its desired architecture. Most of the patterns not only capture structural but also significant behavioral architectural aspects that need to be checked. In case all properties of the system are known before runtime, static compliance checks of application code and configuration files might be sufficient. However, in case aspects of the system dynamically evolve, e.g., due to manual reconfiguration, compliance with the architectural patterns also needs to be monitored during runtime. In this paper, we propose to link compliance rules to architectural patterns that specify behavioral aspects of the patterns based on runtime events using stream queries. These queries serve as input for a complex event processing component to automatically monitor architecture compliance of a running system. To validate the practical feasibility, we applied the approach to a set of architectural patterns in the domain of distributed systems and prototypically implemented a compliance monitor.

AB Emerging network architectures like Information-Centric Networking (ICN) offer simplicity in the data plane by addressing named data. Such flexibility opens up the possibility to move data processing inside network elements for high-performance computation, known as in-network processing. However, existing ICN architectures are limited in terms of (i) in-network processing and (ii) data plane programming abstractions. Such architectures can benefit from Complex Event Processing (CEP), an in-network processing paradigm to efficiently process data inside the data plane. Yet, it is extremely challenging to integrate CEP because the current communication model of ICN is limited to consumer-initiated interaction that comes with significant overhead in number of requests to process continuous data streams. In contrast, a change to producer-initiated interaction, as favored by CEP, imposes severe limitations for request-reply interactions.
   In this paper, we propose an in-network CEP architecture, INETCEP that supports unified interaction patterns (consumer-and producer-initiated). In addition, we provide a CEP query language and facilitate CEP operations while increasing the range of applications that can be supported by ICN. We provide an open source implementation and evaluation of INETCEP over an ICN architecture, Named Function Networking, and two applications: energy forecasting in smart homes and a disaster scenario.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) detects complex events or patterns of event sequences based on a set of rules defined by a domain expert. However, it lowers the reliability of a system as the set of rules defined by an expert changes along with dynamic changes in the domain environment. A human error made by an expert is another factor that may undermine the reliability of the system. In an effort to address such problems, this study introduces Collaborative Rule Mining Engine (CRME) designed to automatically mine rules based on the history of decisions made by a domain expert by adopting a collaborative filtering approach, which is effective in mimicking and predicting human decision-making in an environment where there are sufficient data or information to do so. Furthermore, this study suggests an adaptive CEP technique, which does not hamper the reliability since it prevents potential errors caused by mistakes of domain experts and adapts to changes in the domain environment on its own as it is linked to the system proposed by Bharagavi [10]. In a bid to verify this technique, an automated stocks trading system will be established and its performance will be measured using the rate of return.

AB In their model of social phobia, Clark and Wells [1995. A cognitive model of social phobia. In R. G. Heimberg, M. Liebowitz, D. A. Hope & F. Schneier (Eds.), Social phobia: Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment (pp. 69-93). New York, London: The Guilford Press] introduced a process called "post-event processing" (PEP), which is characterized by prolonged rumination about past social situations. The present study examined to what extent PEP is specific for (a) social anxiety or (b) social situations. In a cross-sectional study, 217 participants reported about a social and a phobic event followed by negative thinking. PEP as well as its potential predictors such as social anxiety, general anxiety, and depression were measured by questionnaires. Results showed that social events were followed more often and by more intense PEP. Further confirming specificity, the fear of negative evaluation as an aspect of social anxiety was significantly associated with PEP for social but not for phobic situations, and vice versa; general anxiety predicted PEP only after phobic but not after social situations. Furthermore, PEP was elevated particularly for interaction (as opposed to performance) situations, indicating that the ambiguity of the situation may be an important predictor for prolonged processing.

AB This paper describes iSensNet, an infrastructure that we designed and implemented for various research and development projects in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). iSensNet is composed of a WSN platform and an event publish/subscribe middleware. On the WSN platform, users can test their protocols of any and all non-physical layers; the platform provides real time performance evaluation of the protocols. With the provided middleware, iSensNet is able to accept event subscriptions, to decompose an event to sub-events, to build up event detection trees composed of these sub-events, to collaborate in detecting the sub-events, and handle the event for various application programs. This paper focuses on the design of iSensNet, taking into consideration the severe resource constraints despite the high performance requirements of the applications.

AB We study event processing in locally distributed real-time systems. ne objective is to use event-triggered communication together with a time-synchronization protocol, in particular, IEEE 1588 over Ethernet, to achieve the similar level of determinism as in statically scheduled time-triggered systems. Given a distributed application with component properties and input event rate characterization, we discuss an analytic procedure that bounds performance parameters. These parameters are also necessary for deterministic implementation of the application. The procedure is experimentally evaluated on a setup with standard software and networking components.

TI Extracting Message Sequence Charts from Hindi Narrative Text
SO NARRATIVE UNDERSTANDING, STORYLINES, AND EVENTS
DT Proceedings Paper
CT 1st Joint Workshop on Narrative Understanding, Storylines, and Events
CY JUL09, 2020
CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB In this paper, we propose the use of Message Sequence Charts (MSC) as a representation for visualizing narrative text in Hindi. An MSC is a formal representation allowing the depiction of actors and interactions among these actors in a scenario, apart from supporting a rich framework for formal inference. We propose an approach to extract MSC actors and interactions from a Hindi narrative. As a part of the approach, we enrich an existing event annotation scheme where we provide guidelines for annotation of the mood of events (realis vs irrealis) and guidelines for annotation of event arguments. We report performance on multiple evaluation criteria by experimenting with Hindi narratives from Indian History. Though Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, from the NLP perspective it has comparatively lesser resources than English. Moreover, there is relatively less work in the context of event processing in Hindi. Hence, we believe that this work is among the initial works for Hindi event processing.

AB Today event-driven business process management has matured from a scientific vision to a realizable methodology for companies of all sizes and shapes. This vision can be applied for business monitoring, as well as for compliance monitoring. However, leveraging the power of complex event processing for supporting business process monitoring is cumbersome because of the complicated modeling of rules and alerts as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) in machine readable format using the event languages. However, using a model-driven approach for generating a monitoring infrastructure based on events like the aPro architecture is one possibility to enable companies with various infrastructures to leverage the advantages of business process monitoring. This article describes how KPIs are modeled and transferred into event rules by a model-driven approach. Two use cases are the basis for defining requirements and evaluating the approach, showing it tackles challenges from business monitoring as well as from compliance monitoring.

AB Fluent event processing involves selectively attending to information-rich regions within dynamically unfolding sensory streams (e.g., Newtson, 1973). What counts as information-rich likely depends on numerous factors, however, including overall event novelty and local opportunity for repeated viewing. Using Hard, Recchia, and Tversky's (2011) method, we investigated the extent to which these two variables affected viewers' attentional patterns as events unfolded. Specifically, we recorded viewers' "dwell times" as they advanced through two slideshows depicting distinct methods of shoelace tying varying in novelty but equated on other dimensions. Across two experiments, novelty sparked increased dwelling overall, and viewers' dwelling patterns displayed rapid and systematic reorganization to structure within the activity stream after just one viewing of distinctively novel content. As well, increased dwelling positively predicted memory performance. These findings newly illuminate reorganization in attention as relevant information within novel activity sequences is quickly incorporated to guide event processing and support event memory.

AB Abundant sensors and smart devices deployed in the Internet of Things pose the potential for IoT applications to detect high-level meaningful events. Complex Event Processing technology offers solutions of event pattern(complex event) queries over streams in real time well timely. Yet when CEP is detecting complex events that are continuous for some time, it results in detecting out multiple reduplicate pattern matches, leading to the burden of high output throughput and unnecessary disturb to IoT applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient Event-Feedback Mechanism, to eliminate these reduplicate pattern matches via letting the first detected complex event feedback to the input stream and detecting each selected event based on "evenly spaced time window" and Poisson distribution. The Event-Feedback Mechanism is shown to achieve over three orders of magnitude performance in relieving output throughput, and a range of tested scenarios compared to a significant algorithm proves it practical and effective.

AB Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) is a commonly used paradigm to detect and act on situational changes of many applications, including the Internet of Things (IoT). DCEP achieves this using a simple specification of analytical tasks on data streams called operators and their distributed execution on a set of infrastructure. The adaptivity of DCEP to the dynamics of IoT applications is essential and very challenging in the face of changing demands concerning Quality of Service. In our previous work, we addressed this issue by enabling transitions, which allow for the adaptive use of operator placement mechanisms. In this article, we extend the transition methodology by optimizing the costs of transition and analyzing the behavior using multiple operator placement mechanisms. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation on the costs of transition imposed by operator migrations and learning, as it can inflict overhead on the performance if operated uncoordinatedly.

TI Predictive Analytics by Using Bayesian Model Averaging for Large-Scale
   Internet of Things

AB Massive events can be produced today because of the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Complex event processing, which can be used to extract high-level patterns from raw data, has become an essential part of the IoT middleware. Prediction analytics is an important technology in supporting proactive complex event processing. In this paper, we propose the use of dynamic Bayesian model averaging to develop a high-accuracy prediction analytic method for large-scale IoT application. This method, which is based on a new multilayered adaptive dynamic Bayesian network model, uses Gaussian mixture models and expectation-maximization inference for basic Bayesian prediction. Bayesian model averaging is implemented by using Markov chain Monte Carlo approximation, and a novel dynamic Bayesian model averaging method is proposed based on event context clustering. Simulation experiments show that the proposed prediction analytic method has better accuracy compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits acceptable performance when implemented in large-scale IoT applications.

AB With recent developments in science and technology, numerous researchers around the world are producing a variety of science- and technology-related documents such as research papers and patents in order to share and further develop their respective research. In particular, the spread of social network services is allowing researchers in science and technology to share and develop their latest technologies at a fast rate. In the era of Big Data, there are increasing needs for a system that can infer analytical information about the research activities of such researchers, but no system that satisfies the requirements exists at the moment. Therefore, this study proposes a sematic complex event processing model for reasoning. The study then details an architecture in which such analytics is processed on a real-time basis in a distributed environment. With this architecture, researchers can easily monitor their individual research activities in an up to date manner and use such analytical data as a basis to set their future research directions.

ID DISSEMINATION; INFORMATION
AB PUBSUB is a versatile, efficient, and scalable content-based publish/subscribe system. This paper describes the architecture of PUBSUB together with some of its current capabilities. A version of PUBSUB optimized for event processing was benchmarked against the publish/subscribe systems BE-Tree and Siena, which also are optimized for event processing. Although the run time performance of both BE-Tree and PUBSUB is orders of magnitude better than that of Siena, BE-Tree is able to handle only a restricted class of predicates while PUBSUB can handle most predicate types handled by Siena. On our tests, the speedup of the fastest version of PUBSUB relative to Siena ranged from a low of 18 to a high of 1,703 and averaged 185. The speedup range relative to BE-Tree was up to 9.81 and averaged 2.37. Siena's memory requirements are about a fourth of those of BE-Tree and PUBSUB. The memory required by the most memory efficient of PUBSUB's data structures was between 4 and 16 percent less that required by BE-Tree. With respect to data structure initialization, the three systems took a comparable amount of time on some data sets while on some PUBSUB could be initialized in 1/7th time required to initialize Siena and 1/14th that to initialize BE-Tree. PUBSUB achieves its high performance from the use of very efficient data structures and event matching algorithms.

AB Background and objectives: People with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) evaluate themselves negatively before, during, and after anxiety-provoking social situations, which leads to negative consequences (e.g., performance deficits, memory impairments, and post-event processing). Despite decades of research, little is known regarding whether these evaluations generalize to how they view others. Social projection theory-the belief that others are similar to oneself-might further extend the basic Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) model. Our aim was to understand whether the degree to which people negatively evaluate a visibly anxious person causes them to negatively evaluate themselves.Methods: 172 unselected participants completed several baseline questionnaires. We then randomly assigned participants to provide high-, medium-, or no-evaluation of a videotaped anxious person (i.e., other-evaluations) while we assessed their state anxiety. After, they evaluated the anxious person on multiple criteria. Participants then participated in an impromptu conversation task and subsequently evaluated their own performance. Results: Although our manipulation was effective, we found no emotional or behavioural differences between conditions. However, people in the high-evaluation condition recalled significantly fewer facts about their conversation partner than did people in the medium-and no-evaluation conditions.Limitations: After data cleaning, the sample size was slightly smaller than planned; most analyses were none-theless appropriately powered. Our findings may not generalize beyond unselected undergraduate students; replication in a clinical sample is warranted.Conclusions: These findings highlight the cognitive consequences (i.e., memory impairments) of other-evaluations, which cognitive behavioural therapists should consider when treating individuals with SAD.

AB The coating process in lithium-ion battery manufacturing is designed to distribute stirred slurry on substrates. The coating results have a significant effect on the performance of lithium-ion batteries. A well-controlled coating process can avoid material wastage in manufacturing and improve the safety of lithium-ion batteries. Studies have focused on factors that influence coating results. However, no systematic research has been conducted on the control of the coating process. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive but efficient approach to monitoring the results of slurry coating. A data measurement system, combined with cumulative sum charts and complex event processing, were developed to monitor the coating process. As part of our research, we utilized a cumulative sum chart to detect small changes in coating that could not be detected easily. Additionally, anomalies in the process were detected using complex event processing. Our work was applied in a real-world setting, and the experimental results showed that it was effective in detecting small changes in the slurry coating. Our research can be able to contribute to the development of a solution for the process control of slurry coating in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries as well as bridge the gap between research and industry.

   Optimization
AB Complex event processing (CEP) is a prominent technology used in many modern applications for monitoring and tracking events of interest in massive data streams. CEP engines inspect real-time information flows and attempt to detect combinations of occurrences matching predefined patterns. This is done by combining basic data items, also called "primitive events", according to a pattern detection plan, in a manner similar to the execution of multi-join queries in traditional data management systems. Despite this similarity, little work has been done on utilizing existing join optimization methods to improve the performance of CEP-based systems.
   In this paper, we provide the first theoretical and experimental study of the relationship between these two research areas. We formally prove that the CEP Plan Generation problem is equivalent to the Join Query Plan Generation problem for a restricted class of patterns and can be reduced to it for a considerably wider range of classes. This result implies the NP-completeness of the CEP Plan Generation problem. We further show how join query optimization techniques developed over the last decades can be adapted and utilized to provide practically efficient solutions for complex event detection. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of these techniques over existing strategies for CEP optimization in terms of throughput, latency, and memory consumption.

TI Optimizing SIEM Throughput on the Cloud Using Parallelization

ID EVENT
AB Processing large amounts of data in real time for identifying security issues pose several performance challenges, especially when hardware infrastructure is limited. Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP), mostly hosting their applications on the Cloud, receive events at a very high rate that varies from a few hundred to a couple of thousand events per second (EPS). It is critical to process this data efficiently, so that attacks could be identified quickly and necessary response could be initiated. This paper evaluates the performance of a security framework OSTROM built on the Esper complex event processing (CEP) engine under a parallel and non-parallel computational framework. We explain three architectures under which Esper can be used to process events. We investigated the effect on throughput, memory and CPU usage in each configuration setting. The results indicate that the performance of the engine is limited by the number of events coming in rather than the queries being processed. The architecture where 1/4th of the total events are submitted to each instance and all the queries are processed by all the units shows best results in terms of throughput, memory and CPU usage.

AB We contribute a new paradigm for publish/subscribe systems. It is centered on the novel notion of subscription summarization. We first present the summarization structures for a broker's subscriptions and accompanying algorithms, which operate on the summary structures to match incoming events to the brokers with relevant subscriptions and for the maintenance of subscriptions in the face of updates. Second, we present novel algorithms for efficiently propagating subscription summaries to brokers. Finally, we present a novel algorithm for the efficient distributed processing of incoming events, utilizing the propagated subscription summaries to route the events to brokers with matched subscriptions. We study the performance of our contributions, comparing them against a baseline approach and against corresponding techniques employed in a well-known event-based distributed system. Our results show the significant performance gains introduced for both the subscription propagation and distributed event processing tasks.

AB This paper presents a custom MSP430 (TM)-compatible microcontroller, specifically tailored for quasi-digital processing Address Event Representation (AER) events. Main target applications are fully reprogrammable sensory systems where events pre-processing has to be carried out by means of easily-tunable elaboration algorithms; a microcontroller-based design could provide the right trade-off between flexibility and performance. Key features are good time resolution, high reactivity, on-demand only processing and power consumption reduction. The proposed architecture has been analyzed and compared with an open source MSP430 (TM)-compliant microcontroller (openMSP430) in terms of performance and power consumption. Accurate and wide cases-spectrum simulations (targeting ASIC technology) show an average power consumption reduction ranging from 50% (same operating frequency) up to 79% (same maximum event rate); equivalently, with the same power budget, an average improvement of either resolution of 84% or maximum event rate of 1020% is obtained.

AB Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) has been the target of many optimizations through the years. However, PDES on shared-memory and multi-core machines still lacks a broader consideration of memory-awareness to enhance its performance. The aim of the work carried out during my PhD is to provide a holistic approach to fully exploit speculative PDES platforms and improve the overall memory utilization leveraging Linux kernel's services, tackling event processing in a memory-aware way, improving traditional speculative PDES operations like state saving, up to managing simulation's inspection through output collection.

AB The emergence of Industry 4.0 leads to the optimization of all the industrial operations management. Maintenance is a key operation function, since it contributes significantly to the business performance. However, the definition and conceptualization of Condition-based Predictive Maintenance (CPM) in the frame of Industry 4.0 is not clear yet. In the current paper, we: (i) explicitly define CPM in the frame of Industry 4.0 (alternatively referred as Proactive Maintenance); (ii) develop a unified approach for its implementation; and, (iii) provide a conceptual architecture for associated information systems.

DE Node.js; event-driven architecture; atomicity violation; happens-before
ID RACE DETECTION; BUGS
AB Node.js has been widely-used as an event-driven server-side architecture. To improve performance, a task in a Node.js application is usually divided into a group of events, which are non-deterministically scheduled by Node.js. Developers may assume that the group of events (named atomic event group) should be atomically processed, without interruption. However, the atomicity of an atomic event group is not guaranteed by Node.js, and thus other events may interrupt the execution of the atomic event group, break down the atomicity and cause unexpected results. Existing approaches mainly focus on event race among two events, and cannot detect high-level atomicity violations among a group of events. In this paper, we propose NodeAV, which can predictively detect atomicity violations in Node.js applications based on an execution trace. Based on happens-before relations among events in an execution trace, we automatically identify a pair of events that should be atomically processed, and use predefined atomicity violation patterns to detect atomicity violations. We have evaluated NodeAV on real-world Node.js applications. The experimental results show that NodeAV can effectively detect atomicity violations in these Node.js applications.

AB Many ICT applications need to make sense of large volumes of streaming data to detect situations of interest and enable timely reactions. Stream Reasoning (SR) aims to combine the performance of stream/event processing and the reasoning expressiveness of knowledge representation systems by adopting Semantic Web standards to encode streaming elements. We argue that the mainstream SR model is not flexible enough to properly express the temporal relations common in many applications. We show that the model can miss relevant information and lead to inconsistent derivations. Moving from these premises, we introduce a novel SR model that provides expressive ontological and temporal reasoning by neatly decoupling their scope to avoid losses and inconsistencies. We implement the model in the DOTR system that defines ontological reasoning using Datalog rules and temporal reasoning using a Complex Event Processing language that builds on metric temporal logic. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our model through examples and benchmarks, and we show that DOTR outperforms state-of-the-art SR tools, processing data with millisecond latency.

AB Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that produce sparse and asynchronous event streams instead of frame-based images at a high-rate. Recent works utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance in recognition tasks, which model event stream as spatio-temporal graph. However, the computational mechanism of graph convolution introduces redundant computation when aggregating neighbor features, which limits the low-latency nature of the events. And they perform a synchronous inference process, which can not achieve a fast response to the asynchronous event signals. This paper proposes a local-shift graph convolutional network (LSNet), which utilizes a novel local-shift operation equipped with a local spatio-temporal attention component to achieve efficient and adaptive aggregation of neighbor features. To improve the efficiency of pooling operation in feature extraction, we design a node-importance based parallel pooling method (NIPooling) for sparse and low-latency event data. Based on the calculated importance of each node, NIPooling can efficiently obtain uniform sampling results in parallel, which retains the diversity of event streams. Furthermore, for achieving a fast response to asynchronous event signals, an asynchronous event processing procedure is proposed to restrict the network nodes which need to recompute activations only to those affected by the new arrival event. Experimental results show that the computational cost can be reduced by nearly 9 times through using local-shift operation and the proposed asynchronous procedure can further improve the inference efficiency, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on gesture recognition and object recognition.

AB Background: Post-event processing (PEP) refers to negative rumination following anxiety-inducing social situations. The Post-Event Processing Inventory (PEPI; Blackie & Kocovski, 2017, Development and validation of the trait and state versions of the post-event processing inventory. Anxiety, Stress, & Coping, 30, 202-218.) consists of both trait and state forms. Although the psychometric properties of the PEPI have been very good in past research, the factor structure of the scale was examined with student samples only. Objectives: The primary purpose of the present study was to confirm the factor structure of the PEPI with a sample of individuals seeking self-help for social anxiety and shyness. Design and Method: Individuals interested in receiving self-help (N = 155) completed a battery of questionnaires, including the trait and state forms of the PEPI. Results: On each version of the scale, we confirmed that a second-order factor (global PEP) could be inferred from three first-order factors (frequency, intensity, and self-judgment). Conclusions: The hierarchical factor structure of the PEPI in the present study is consistent with previous research. The findings from the present study illustrate the utility of the PEPI amongst a community sample of individuals seeking self-help for social anxiety.

AB Many applications need to access a large amount of data objects maintained in secondary storage. The performance of such applications has a critical dependency on the efficiency of the underlying object store. Traditional object store systems do not allow for cache management in an application-sensitive manner and therefore provide sub-optimal performance only. In this paper, we propose a novel object store whose caching behavior is driven by an object persistence model. The object persistence model captures an application's overall object access patterns, including those extracted from user-defined functions. A model transformer takes the object access patterns as input and creates appropriate caching policies and in-memory object indexes for the cache. We have implemented such an object store on top of a relational database system to utilize the persistence, concurrency control and data integrity mechanisms of the database system. We have further validated our design by deploying and measuring the object store in a business event processing application.

AB Smart buildings equipped with sensors and electronic devices as a Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) offer great research perspective to explore communication, computation and controlling of physical devices by using real time Complex Event Processing (CEP) and analytics. Since, CPS like Smart-Building involves the integration of several types of equipment interoperability, maintainability, signaling, bandwidth, reliability, security, privacy, authentications, data storage, heterogeneity and cost effectiveness are the critical issues to be addressed. In addition, interactivity and dynamic feedback, context correlation with respect to streaming events and uncertainties in event composition are also identified as major challenging issues. To handle all these challenges integration of smart buildings with CEP and real-time data analytics are emerging as a new area of research. In the present research, a model for real time CEP and analytics have been proposed for Smart-Building at IIIT Allahabad, India. The research work includes background study, data collection, recognizing simple and complex events, stream processing, and automated construction of event definitions using machine learning, event-based real time decision-making and performance tests. The study includes deployment of various sensors and actuators for gathering smart building data. Raspberry Pi board is used to collect data from sensors and communicate the collected data to cloud for analytics. The research will also highlight the strength, weakness, and challenges addressed in the proposed system.

AB Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) engage in post-event processing, a form of perseverative thinking. Given that deficits in working memory might underlie perseverative thinking, we examined working memory in SAD with a particular focus on the effects of stimulus valence. SAD (n = 31) and healthy control (n = 20) participants either maintained (forward trials) or reversed (backward trials) in working memory the order of four emotional or four neutral pictures, and we examined sorting costs, which reflect the extent to which performance deteriorated on the backward trials compared to the forward trials. Emotionality of stimuli affected performance of the two groups differently. Whereas control participants exhibited higher sorting costs for emotional stimuli compared to neutral stimuli, SAD participants exhibited the opposite pattern. Greater attention to emotional stimuli in SAD might facilitate the processing of emotional (vs. neutral) stimuli in working memory.

ID EXTRACTION
AB In order to improve the ability of sentence event detection in natural language processing and solve the problem of event processing caused by polysemy, an event detection model based on neural network is proposed. The model adjusts the structure to a hierarchical neural network model based on neural network, and introduces attention calculation into the internal structure to realise the correlation analysis of sentence context. The value of the model is judged through performance analysis and application test. The results show that the average harmonic value of the model in polysemy detection is 74.1%, which is higher than the existing model. The application test shows that the model can detect events for sentences in different environments. The results show that the hierarchical neural network event detection model with deep contextual representation and attention mechanism has good performance, which provides theoretical support for the development of multi event detection technology.

TI Halide perovskite memristor with ultra-high-speed and robust flexibility

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
DT Article
ID THRESHOLD SWITCHING MEMRISTOR; MEMORY; PERFORMANCE
AB Threshold switching (TS) memristor-based artificial neurons have been regarded as one of the promising solutions for constructing circuits of spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to their intrinsic similarity to biological neurons. Limited by their materials and process, current flexible TS memristors still face significant challenges in obtaining both a fast-operating speed and robust flexibility. This paper demonstrates flexible TS memristors with Au/organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite (OIHP)/Au/polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) structures by a low-cost solution process, which exhibit an ultrahigh switching speed (<35/90 ns) and a robust flexibility. The leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics and strength-modulated spike frequency response of the devices as artificial neurons are simulated through SPICE. The switching speed of the devices depending on the spike event processing ability and the energy efficiency of SNNs is analyzed. Inspired by the Na+ ion influx of biological neurons, an iodine (I-) vacancy migration model is established to clarify the working mechanism of the ultrahigh switching speed. The potential cause of their robust flexibility is also carefully studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). This work provides a new method for exploiting high-performance flexible artificial neurons and energy-efficient SNNs.

AB The spectroscopic performance of x-ray instruments can be affected at high count rates. The effects and mitigation in the optical chain, such as x-ray attenuation filters or de-focusing mirrors, are widely discussed, but those in the signal chain are not. Using the Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter onboard the XRISM satellite, we discuss the effects observed during high count rate measurements and how these can be modeled. We focus on three instrumental effects that impact performance at high count rate: CPU limit, pile up, and electrical cross talk. High count rate data were obtained during ground testing using the flight model instrument and a calibration x-ray source. A simulated observation of GX 13+1 is presented to illustrate how to estimate these effects based on these models for observation planning. The impact of these effects on high count rate observations is discussed.

TI FLAS: A combination of proactive and reactive auto-scaling architecture
   for distributed services
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
DT Article
DE Cloud; Elasticity; Automatic scaling; Distributed systems
AB Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a content-based publish-subscribe middle ware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

AB This paper is part of a continuing effort in the field of EC to develop algorithms that follow an opportunistic approach to computing, allowing the exploitation of freely available services over the Internet by using free tiers of cloud services or volunteer computing resources; the EvoSpace model is able to tap from both kind of resources, using asynchronous evolutionary algorithms. We present its design, which follows an an event-driven architecture and asynchronous I/O model, and its implementation, with a server-side tier programmed in Node.js that uses Redis as an in-memory and high performance data store for the population. This population store is exposed to clients running population-based and nature-inspired metaheuristics through a REST API. Additional capabilities where implemented in this version to allow the logging of experiments where heterogeneous algorithms are executed in parallel. These logs can then be transformed to other formats. As a case study an hybrid global optimization algorithm has been implemented mixing two algorithms: a PSO algorithm from the EvoloPy library and a GA using the DEAP framework. The result was transformed to files compatible to the Comparing Continuous Optimizer platform in order to use their post-processing code. Clients in this case have been developed in the Python language, the language used to implement both libraries. The results from this case study suggest, first, that EvoSpace can be used as a paradigm-and language-agnostic platform for population-based optimization algorithms, and also that this software can yield performance improvements and a viable platform to execute and compare asynchronous pool-based metaheuristics.

AB Today's streaming applications demand increasingly high event throughput rates and are often subject to strict latency constraints. To allow for more complex workloads, such as window-based aggregations, streaming systems need to support stateful event processing. This introduces new challenges for streaming engines as the state needs to be maintained in a consistent and durable manner and simultaneously accessed by complex queries for real-time analytics.
   Modern streaming systems, such as Apache Rink, do not allow for efficiently exposing the state to analytical queries. Thus, data engineers are forced to keep the state in external data stores, which significantly increases the latencies until events become visible to analytical queries. Proprietary solutions have been created to meet data freshness constraints. These solutions are expensive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. Main-memory database systems, such as HyPer, achieve extremely low query response times while maintaining high update rates, which makes them well-suited for analytical streaming workloads. In this article, we explore extensions to database systems to match the performance and usability of streaming systems.

AB Today, the IT world is trying to cope with "big data" problems (data volume, velocity, variety, veracity) on the path to obtaining useful information. In this paper, we present implementation details and performance results of realizing "online" Association Rule Mining (ARM) over big data streams for the first time in the literature. Specifically, we added Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for stream mining inside an event processing engine, called Esper. Using the system, these two algorithms were compared over LastFM social music site data and by using tumbling windows. The better-performing FP-Growth was selected and used in creation of a real-time rule-based recommendation engine. Our most important findings show that online association rule mining can generate (1) more rules, (2) much faster and more efficiently, and (3) much sooner than offline rule mining. In addition, we have found many interesting and realistic musical preference rules such as "George Harrison double right arrow Beatles". We hope that our findings can shed light on the design and implementation of other big data analytics systems in the future.

AB Content-based publish/subscribe networks (CPSNs) scale to large numbers of publishers and subscribers by having brokers summarize subscriptions from subscribers and downstream brokers based on coverage relationships ("subsumption") between subscriptions. A broker forwards the summary to brokers which are upstream on the routes to the publishers. Current summarization and event processing mechanisms induce heavy event processing load on brokers, leading to low event throughput and high latency and further sharp performance degradation under high rates of churn, i.e., addition, deletion, or modification of subscriptions.
   This paper describes Beretta, a novel CPSN that leverages a simple model of typed events, enabling a succinct and uniform normalized representation of subscriptions. This in turn supports highly effective subsumption and attribute-wise split filtering with matching complexity logarithmic in the number of subscriptions, and enables the systematic introduction of parameters into subscriptions to support both parametric and structural updates. We empirically demonstrate that our techniques significantly improve throughput and latency of event propagation and reduce response times to subscription updates.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged from the proliferation of mobile devices and objects connected, resulting in the acquisition of periodic event flows from different devices and sensors. However, such sensors and devices can be faulty or affected by failures, have poor calibration, and produce inaccurate data and uncertain event flows in IoT applications. A prominent technique for analyzing event flows is Complex Event Processing (CEP). Uncertainty in CEP is usually observed in primitive events (i.e., sensor readings) and rules that derive complex events (i.e., high-level situations). In this paper, we investigate the identification and treatment of uncertainty in CEP-based IoT applications. We propose the DST-CEP, an approach that uses the Dempster-Shafer Theory to treat uncertainties. By using this theory, our solution can combine unreliable sensor data in conflicting situations and detect correct results. DST-CEP has an architectural model for treating uncertainty in events and its propagation to processing rules. We describe a case study using the proposed approach in a multi-sensor fire outbreak detection system. We submit our solution to experiments with a real sensor dataset, and evaluate it using well-known performance metrics. The solution achieves promising results regarding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure, and ROC Curve, even when combining conflicting sensor readings. DST-CEP demonstrated to be suitable and flexible to deal with uncertainty.

AB ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is preparing for a major upgrade of the detector, readout and computing systems for LHC Run 3. A new facility called O-2 (Online-Offline) will play a major role in data compression and event processing. To efficiently operate the experiment, we are designing a monitoring subsystem, which will provide a complete overview of the O-2 overall health, detect performance degradation and component failures. The monitoring subsystem will receive and collect up to 600 kHz of performance metrics. It consists of a custom monitoring library and a server-side, distributed software covering five main functional tasks: parameter collection and processing, storage, visualisation and alarms. To select the most appropriate tools for these tasks, we evaluated three options: "Modular Stack", Zabbix and the currently used ALICE Grid monitoring tool called MonALISA. The former one consists of a toolkit including collectd, Apache Flume, Apache Spark, InfluxDB, Grafana and Riemann. This paper describes the monitoring subsystem functional architecture. It goes through a complete evaluation of the three considered options, the selection process, risk assessment and justification for the final decision. The in-depth comparison includes functional features and throughput measurement to ensure the required processing and storage performance.

AB The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab, with the aim to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to an unprecedented level of 140 ppb, has started beam and detector commissioning in Summer 2017. To deal with incoming data projected to be around tens of petabytes, a robust data reconstruction and analysis chain based on Fermilab's art event-processing framework is developed. Herein, I report the current status of the framework, together with its novel features such as multi-threaded algorithms for online data quality monitor (DQM) and fast-turnaround operation (nearline). Performance of the framework during the commissioning run is also discussed.

AB We designed a switchless event building farm for the Belle experiment at the KEKB e(+)e(-) collider, as a replacement of the existing event builder and the online farm systems. In the new system, PCs are directly interconnected with multiple point-to-point Fast and Gigabit Ethernet connections. The PCs build the detector data in two steps to perform distributed event processing. We set up a test system and confirmed the event building performance meets our new requirements using a realistic prototype software. The system is being installed as sceduled using the summer shutdown time in 2001.

AB The paper studies on the modeling and prediction method for multi-attribute events, which exist widely in practical application. In view of the features of multi-attribute events, the paper proposes an event processing framework including the construction of training sample space based on multi-attribute event grid (MAEG), bi-direction SVR (Support Vector Regression) modeling method for prediction based on longitudinal modeling and transverse modeling, and model updating strategy based on e-insensitive error. The performance of the proposed methods of the framework is demonstrated by extensive experiments with real datasets.

DE Serverless; FaaS; Edge Computing; IoT
AB The Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is a great fit for data and event processing in the Internet of Things (IoT). Sending all data to a cloud-based FaaS platform, however, may cause performance and privacy issues. While these issues could be mitigated using edge computing, existing FaaS approaches, designed for the cloud, are too heavyweight to run on small, constrained edge nodes.
   In this paper, we propose tinyFaaS, a new FaaS system that is specifically designed for edge environments and their unique challenges. Our platform is lightweight enough to run on low-performance single machine edge nodes, provides a CoAP endpoint to support communication with low-power devices, and uses Docker containers to isolate tenants. We evaluate tinyFaaS through a proof-of-concept implementation that we benchmark and compare to state-of-the-art FaaS platforms. For IoT processing scenarios, we find that tinyFaaS outperforms existing systems by at least an order of magnitude.

AB Two repetitive thinking processes that have been proposed in prominent maintenance models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) are anticipatory processing and post-event processing. Research into these two processes has steadily increased over the last 20 years. This review highlights the main lines of existing research on anticipatory processing and post-event processing, including studies on the nature of these processes, their association with social anxiety, the predictors, and consequences of these processes, as well as how these processes respond to treatments for SAD. The review also highlights some of the conceptual and methodological issues that have prevented the literature on anticipatory processing and post-event processing from being more integrated and focused. Finally, the review draws together some new directions in terms of theory and research to further advance the field.

ID PERMISSIVE DISTRIBUTED CONTROL; ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS
AB It often takes much time and effort to synthesize the supervisory controller given an automated manufacturing system (AMS). Any modification may lead to another synthesis procedure from the scratch. This work is motivated by the problem of distributed supervisor synthesis for complex large scale models of real systems. Existing approaches generally require the enumeration of all the states or siphons. Based on them, a centralized supervisor can be synthesized to perform on-line control. In this paper, we provide an on-line and realtime predictive control solution in order to significantly mitigate the computational burden and reduce the supervisor size. Our approach can minimize the communication amount among different processes, tolerate many contingencies like resource failure and improve system performance like throughput. These promote its applicability to many practical large scale systems. The supervisor synthesis procedure can also be adapted to other event-driven systems like warehouse, transportation, and logistics systems, which require a distributed and networked supervisor.

   Video Event Detection; Video Streams
AB Video data is highly expressive and has traditionally been very difficult for a machine to interpret. Querying event patterns from video streams is challenging due to its unstructured representation. Middleware systems such as Complex Event Processing (CEP) mine patterns from data streams and send notifications to users in a timely fashion. Current CEP systems have inherent limitations to query video streams due to their unstructured data model and lack of expressive query language. In this work, we focus on a CEP framework where users can define high-level expressive queries over videos to detect a range of spatiotemporal event patterns. In this context, we propose- i) VidCEP. an in-memory, on the fly, near real-time complex event matching framework for video streams. The system uses a graph-based event representation for video streams which enables the detection of high-level semantic concepts from video using cascades of Deep Neural Network models, ii) a Video Event Query language (VEQL) to express high-level user queries for video streams in CEP, Hi) a complex event matcher to detect spatiotemporal video event patterns by matching expressive user queries over video data. The proposed approach detects spatiotemporal video event patterns with an F-score ranging from 0.66 to 0.89. VidCEP maintains near real-time performance with an average throughput of 70 frames per second for 5 parallel videos with sub-second matching latency.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is an emerging technology gaining a lot of momentum in research as well as in commercial products. CEP is a technique that utilizes event-driven IT-systems to monitor optimize and steer todays business situations in real-time. Lots of contributions have been published on how to handle large amounts of event streams and how to extract meaningful knowledge out of often fine-grained events. From our experience we learned that complex use cases implemented with CEP need appropriate tool support to validate, understand and analyze the event processing done by the CEP software. We introduce the EventCloud system which is a generic event search and analysis tool integrating with CEP solutions in almost every domain. EventCloud is an end user application that allows complex search and analysis of correlated events. As CEP requires a highly specialized system architecture, the characteristics of events also have impacts on the infrastructure for indexing, searching and analyzing events. In this paper we present two approaches describing how to properly represent correlated events in persistent storages to allow performant event indexing and searching. Further we describe the "document-oriented" approach, where correlated events are managed in a full-text index and discuss the problems and pitfalls with its implementation in Apache Lucene. Finally we compare different full-text engines, namely Apache Lucene[7] and Microsoft SQL Server 2005, to analyze their performance and features for event indexing and search.

AB Modern wireless sensor networks require operating system with real-time, low-power, multi-tasking features, in order to quickly deal with matters of wireless sensor nodes. Event-driven systems and multi-threaded systems are two major operating systems used by wireless sensor networks (WSN). To take advantage of salient features of both types, based on mu C/OS-II and WSN characteristics, we have designed a tiny and hybrid embedded operating system, BEE OS, which integrates a pre-emptive real-time kernel supporting batch execution. Besides BEE has a real-time, low-power and multi-tasking feature. We propose a multi-task management scheme with multi-priority queues and analyze its timeliness performance based on a round-robin theoretical model, which leads to our novel design of the preemptive task scheduling algorithm to optimize the average waiting-time of all tasks. Finally, an adaptive method is introduced into BEE OS in order to avoid task starvation. Our experimental results show the overhead and performance comparisons among BEE OS, mu C/OS-II, and TinyOS. Compared with mu C/OS-II, the RAM and Flash of BEE OS are about two-fold down, and the task response time achieved by BEE OS is approximately a quarter of those by TinyOS and mu C/OS-II. BEE operating system can be widely applied to relatively fixed tasks in industrial environments, with low power consumption and preemptive real-time characteristics.

AB Recent PC servers are equipped with multi-core CPUs and it is desired to utilize the full processing power of them for the data analysis in large scale HEP experiments. A software framework basf2 is being developed for the use in the Belle II experiment, a new generation B-factory experiment at KEK, and the parallel event processing to utilize the multi-core CPUs is in its design for the use in the massive data production. The details of the implementation of event parallel processing in the basf2 framework are discussed with the report of preliminary performance study in the realistic use on a 32 core PC server.

AB The formation of episodic memories-memories for life events-is affected by attention during event processing. A leading neurobiological model of attention posits two separate yet interacting systems that depend on distinct regions in lateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). From this dual-attention perspective, dorsal PPC is thought to support the goal-directed allocation of attention, whereas ventral PPC is thought to support reflexive orienting to information that automatically captures attention. To advance understanding of how parietal mechanisms may impact event encoding, we review functional MRI studies that document the relationship between lateral PPC activation during encoding and subsequent memory performance (e.g., later remembering or forgetting). This review reveals that (a) encoding-related activity is frequently observed in human lateral PPC, (b) increased activation in dorsal PPC is associated with later memory success, and (c) increased activation in ventral PPC predominantly correlates with later memory failure. From a dual-attention perspective, these findings suggest that allocating goal-directed attention during event processing increases the probability that the event will be remembered later, whereas the capture of reflexive attention during event processing may have negative consequences for event encoding. The prevalence of encoding-related activation in parietal cortex suggests that neurobiological models of episodic memory should consider how parietal-mediated attentional mechanisms regulate encoding.

AB Cost-efficient operation while satisfying performance and availability guarantees in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is a challenge for Cloud Computing, as these are potentially conflicting objectives. We present a framework for SLA management based on multi-objective optimization. The framework features a forecasting model for determining the best virtual machine-to-host allocation given the need to minimize SLA violations, energy consumption and resource wasting. A comprehensive SLA management solution is proposed that uses event processing for monitoring and enables dynamic provisioning of virtual machines onto the physical infrastructure. We validated our implementation against serveral standard heuristics and were able to show that our approach is significantly better.

AB The current DSA system used in the dispatching control centers in China is a near real-time analysis system with response speed in the order of minutes. Based on a review of the state-of-the-art in online analysis and discussion of distributed data processing and computation architecture patterns, a new online analysis architecture is proposed. The primary goal of the new architecture is to increase the online analysis response speed to the order of seconds. A reference implementation of the proposed online analysis architecture to validate the feasibility of implementing the architecture and some performance testing results are presented.

AB Complex event recognition (CER) applications exhibit various types of uncertainty, ranging from incomplete and erroneous data streams to imperfect complex event patterns. We review CER techniques that handle, to some extent, uncertainty. We examine techniques based on automata, probabilistic graphical models, and first-order logic, which are the most common ones, and approaches based on Petri nets and grammars, which are less frequently used. Several limitations are identified with respect to the employed languages, their probabilistic models, and their performance, as compared to the purely deterministic cases. Based on those limitations, we highlight promising directions for future work.

AB A gesture-based interaction system for smart homes is a part of a complex cyber-physical environment, for which researchers and developers need to address major challenges in providing personalized gesture interactions. However, current research efforts have not tackled the problem of personalized gesture recognition that often involves user identification. To address this problem, we propose in this work a new event-driven service-oriented framework called gesture services for cyber-physical environments (GS-CPE) that extends the architecture of our previous work gesture profile for web services (GPWS). To provide user identification functionality, GS-CPE introduces a two-phase cascading gesture password recognition algorithm for gesture-based user identification using a two-phase cascading classifier with the hidden Markov model and the Golden Section Search, which achieves an accuracy rate of 96.2% with a small training dataset. To support personalized gesture interaction, an enhanced version of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm with multiple gestural input sources and dynamic template adaptation support is implemented. Our experimental results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm can achieve an average accuracy rate of 98.5% in practical scenarios. Comparison results reveal that GS-CPE has faster response time and higher accuracy rate than other gesture interaction systems designed for smart-home environments.

ID QUERY MODEL
AB RDF Stream Processing (RSP) has been proposed as a way of bridging the gap between the Complex Event Processing (CEP) paradigm and the Semantic Web standards. Uncertainty has been recognized as a critical aspect in CEP, but it has received little attention within the context of RSP. In this paper, we investigate the impact of different RSP optimization strategies for uncertainty management. The paper describes (1) an extension of the RSP-QL* data model to capture bind expressions, filter expressions, and uncertainty functions; (2) optimization techniques related to lazy variables and caching of uncertainty functions, and a heuristic for reordering uncertainty filters in query plans; and (3) an evaluation of these strategies in a prototype implementation. The results show that using a lazy variable mechanism for uncertainty functions can improve query execution performance by orders of magnitude while introducing negligible overhead. The results also show that caching uncertainty function results can improve performance under most conditions, but that maintaining this cache can potentially add overhead to the overall query execution process. Finally, the effect of the proposed heuristic on query execution performance was shown to depend on multiple factors, including the selectivity of uncertainty filters, the size of intermediate results, and the cost associated with the evaluation of the uncertainty functions.

AB Major advances in telecommunications and the Internet of Things have given rise to numerous smart city scenarios in which smart services are provided. What was once a dream for the future has now become reality. However, the need to provide these smart services quickly, efficiently, in an interoperable manner and in real time is a cutting-edge technological challenge. Although some software architectures offer solutions in this area, these are often limited in terms of reusability and maintenance by independent modules -involving the need for system downtime when maintaining or evolving, as well as by a lack of standards in terms of the interoperability of their interface. In this paper, we propose a fully reusable microservice architecture, standardized through the use of the Web of things paradigm, and with high efficiency in real-time data processing, supported by complex event processing techniques. To illustrate the proposal, we present a fully reusable implementation of the microservices necessary for the deployment of the architecture in the field of air quality monitoring and alerting in smart ports. The performance evaluation of this architecture shows excellent results.

AB Mutation testing is a testing technique that has been applied successfully to several programming languages. Despite its benefits for software testing, the high computational cost of mutation testing has kept it from being widely used. Several refinements have been proposed to reduce its cost by reducing the number of generated mutants; one of those is evolutionary mutation testing (EMT). Evolutionary mutation testing aims at generating a reduced set of mutants with an evolutionary algorithm, which searches for potentially equivalent and difficult to kill mutants that help improve the test suite. Evolutionary mutation testing has been evaluated in two contexts so far, ie, web service compositions and object-oriented C++ programmes. This study explores its performance when applied to event processing language queries of various domains. This study also considers the impact of the test data, since a lack of events or the need to have specific values in them can hinder testing. The effectiveness of evolutionary mutation testing with the original test data generators and the new internet of things test event generator tool is compared in multiple case studies.

AB Most existing synchronization protocols require that the simulation application be partitioned and mapped to logical processes to make it suitable for parallel execution. Assuming the simulation models some number of physical components, an important design question is how many components should be mapped to each logical process? This is a nontrivial question because logical process ''size'' affects the efficiency of the synchronization protocol, load balance, and approach for implementing shared state variables, as well as the efficiency of the event processing loop within the parallel simulator. This question is studied in the context of a Time Warp-based parallel simulator. Results of two experimental studies are described that compare the performance of parallel simulators using different logical process sizes. One study uses synthetic workloads; the other uses an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. These results show that the choice of logical process size can have a significant effect on performance, and the optimal size depends on model size, the number of available processors, and detailed semantics of the model itself.

AB Cloud computing provides scalable computing resources on demand. Monitoring cloud computing resources is important so that resources can be dynamically allocated, migrated, or shut down to meet users' requirements. Challenges in cloud computing monitoring systems include detecting patterns that might lead to failure of the cloud system, detecting malfunctioning problems within the cloud platform after they occur, and issues related to the fact that existing monitoring solutions are tightly coupled to specific cloud platforms, while there is an emerging need for monitoring solutions that are independent of underlying subsystems. To address these challenges, we designed a hybrid cloud monitoring software architecture that can work as an add-on layer on top of existing cloud computing platforms. The proposed architecture is designed based on facade software design pattern and utilizes complex event processing concept in which data from various primitive metrics streams is processed to detect previously defined patterns. Prototype applications have been developed to demonstrate the architecture's usability. Performance tests were applied to prototype applications. Computation times required for the operation of the proposed architecture were negligible.

AB This paper presents an approach for online outlier detection over multiple data streams based on Complex Event Processing (CEP) to enable driving behavior classification. Driving is a daily task that allows people to move around faster and more comfortably. However, more than half of fatal crashes are related to recklessness behaviors. Reckless maneuvers can be detected with good accuracy by analyzing data relating to the driver-vehicle interaction, abrupt turnings, acceleration and deceleration, for instance. In this paper, we investigate if off-the-shelf smartphones can be used to an online detection of driving behavior. To do so, we have adapted the Z-Score algorithm, a classical outlier detection algorithm, to perform online outlier detection as a data stream processing model, which receives the smartphone and in-vehicle sensors data as input. The evaluation of the approach was carried out in a case study to assess the algorithm. Our results indicate that the algorithm's performance is fairly good in a real world case study since the algorithm's accuracy was 84% and the average processing time was 100 milliseconds.

AB This study investigates Complex Event Processing (CEP) Pattern on Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) applications. RFID technolgy has brought tremendous benefits for the business by incorporating RFID data into supply chain planning and business processing, however, this progress has also raised important problems for RFID data processing. How to mine the signification information from RFID events is a challenge in RFID applications. In this paper, we take an CEP Pattem-oriented approach to process RFID data. A novel event pattern based on semantics operator is proposed. A formalization event hierarchy is used to model complex event with the event ontology, and provides abstract hierarchical views allowing us to view the system activities at different levels. Several complex event patterns are proposed based on semantic event operators. An algorithm is performed to test reorganization performance of patterns, a rule-based method is used to recognize efficiently on primitive event and composite event. The results showed that the advantage of the proposed complex event pattern approach is remarkable. It is concluded that the method of CEP pattern can simplify and improve RFID application.

AB Background: There is growing interest in how problems with othinking for speakingo (Slobin, 1996) interact with language impairment in aphasia (Marshall, 2009). Evidence to date has come from language production tasks, or from non-linguistic input-focused tasks that bear little relation to the processes involved in event communication. The current study describes a novel approach using a non-linguistic communication task, the Event Drawing Task, to investigate event conceptualisation in two people with aphasia, only one of whom is hypothesised to have problems at this level. Aims: The study aims to identify similarities and differences between the event drawing performance of the two aphasic participants and a group of 12 non-brain-damaged controls. Intact event conceptualisation (participant oBobo) would predict a similar performance to controls, while event conceptualisation problems (participant oJacko) would predict differences from control performance. Methods Procedures: oBobo and oJacko both had severe nonfluent aphasia resulting from a single stroke. A number of background language and event-processing assessments were carried out to gain a profile of their abilities. The Event Drawing Task required participants to communicate 32 short video clips of events using only drawing. Five theoretically motivated analyses were performed on the data from the Event Drawing Task, which targeted specific aspects of event conceptualisation. Patterns within control performance were identified, which formed the basis for detailed comparison with the performance of the two people with aphasia. Outcomes Results: As predicted, Bob's performance on the Event Drawing Task mirrored that of controls in all analyses, while Jack's performance differed widely from the controls' on a number of parameters. Importantly, characteristics of Jack's event drawing performance provide further evidence for an event conceptualisation impairment. Conclusions: The findings confirm that event conceptualisation problems may be an additional source of deficit in aphasia. Furthermore, they suggest that these problems are likely to affect non-linguistic, as well as linguistic, forms of communication. This has both theoretical and clinical implications. It suggests that we need to consider othinking for communicationo more generally, in both the assessment and remediation of severe aphasia.

AB Real-time scheduling theory offers constant-time schedulability tests for periodic and sporadic tasks based on utilization bounds. Unfortunately, the periodicity or the minimal interarrival-time assumptions underlying these bounds make them inapplicable to a vast range of aperiodic workloads such as those seen by network routers, Web servers, and event-driven systems. This paper makes several important contributions toward real-time scheduling theory and schedulability analysis. We derive the first known bound for schedulability of aperiodic tasks. The bound is based on a utilization-like metric we call synthetic utilization, which allows implementing constant-time schedulability tests at admission control time. We prove that the synthetic utilization bound for deadline-monotonic scheduling of aperiodic tasks is 1/1+root1/2. We also show that no other time-independent scheduling policy can have a higher schedulability bound. Similarly, we show that EDF has a bound of I and that no dynamic-priority policy has a higher bound. We assess the performance of the derived bound and conclude that it is very efficient in hit-ratio maximization.

AB We present a rigorous methodology and new metrics for fair comparison of server and microserver platforms. Deploying our methodology and metrics, we compare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86 cores running the same real-time financial analytics workload. We define workload-specific but platform-independent performance metrics for platform comparison, targeting both datacenter operators and end users. Our methodology establishes that a server based on the Xeon Phi co-processor delivers the highest performance and energy efficiency. However, by scaling out energy-efficient microservers, we achieve competitive or better energy efficiency than a power-equivalent server with two Sandy Bridge sockets, despite the microserver's slower cores. Using a new iso-QoS metric, we find that the ARM microserver scales enough to meet market throughput demand, that is, a 100% QoS in terms of timely option pricing, with as little as 55% of the energy consumed by the Sandy Bridge server.

AB Clark and Wells (1995) posit that anticipatory processing before a social situation serves to maintain social anxiety. More specifically, ruminative processes similar to post-event processing (PEP) may occur in anticipation of anxiety provoking social events, and in this article, we have labelled this type of anticipatory rumination anticipatory event processing (AnEP). Participants (n = 75) with social anxiety disorder (SAD) completed measures of anticipatory event processing, trait anxious rumination, social anxiety, state anxiety, and PEP, in the context of completing videotaped exposures twice as part of manual-based group cognitive behavioral therapy. AnEP was significantly positively associated with trait anxious rumination and social anxiety and was associated with state anxiety during the first videotaping. AnEP at the two time points was significantly correlated and decreased across the two taped exposures. Greater AnEP at the first taping was associated with greater PEP the following week. PEP after the first videotaped exposure then significantly related to AnEP for the second videotaped exposure several weeks later. Discussion focuses on the similarities between PEP and AnEP as well as implications for cognitive models and treatment of SAD.

TI A Universal Complex Event Processing Mechanism Based on Edge Computing

SO IEEE ACCESS
DT Article
DE Real-time monitoring; Internet of things; complex event processing;
   complex event definition; edge computing
AB The tremendous number of sensors and smart objects deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) pose a huge potential for the IoT real-time monitoring applications to detect and react to the real world. The insufficient capacity of the IoT data real-time processing has hampered the growth of the IoT real-time monitoring applications. We focus on two issues of the IoT data real-time processing: 1) how to efficiently transform a large number of raw sensing data into meaningful complex event, and 2) how to adapt to the complexity and changeability of monitoring business logic. This paper proposes a universal complex event processing (CEP) mechanism for the IoT real-time monitoring. We propose a formalized hierarchical complex event model including raw event, simple event, and complex event, which reduces the complexity of event modeling. The model supports complex time and space semantics to define flexible complex events by a programming way. Based on this model, we propose a CEP system architecture, in which the system is deployed on the network edge between sensing devices in terminal and applications in the cloud. The complex event definition can be mapped to the CEP rule logic script to detect the potential abnormal event timely. The proposed CEP mechanism is universal and suitable to any heterogeneous sensing devices and CEP engine. We demonstrate the efficacy of the mechanism with two application case studies that highlight our proposed complex event model and evaluate the performance improvement with experiments.

TI Optimizing centroiding using indexed table lookup: Application to
   crossed-strip readout
SO AIP ADVANCES
DT Article
ID HIGH-RESOLUTION; ALGORITHMS
AB This paper introduces a hybrid readout system for a cross-strip position-sensitive anode detector that combines a lookup table and weighted averaging. The lookup table approach is used to identify event channels and select appropriate weights based on the corresponding index code for calculating the centroid of the electron cloud. This effectively enhances the readout system's processing speed while preserving the high-resolution advantage of the cross-strip position-sensitive anode. Simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the system. Experimental results demonstrate that this readout method achieves an event processing speed exceeding 10 MHz while maintaining a resolution of 17.96 lp/mm.

TI Experiences from implementation and evaluation of event processing and
   distribution of notifications in an object monitoring service
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
DT Article
AB Organization of events processing and distribution of notifications is a key issue for performance of software monitoring and management systems, particularly for reducing the execution-time overheads they incur. This paper provides practical guidelines for design and implementation of event report generation and dissemination frameworks, based on experiences from implementation, configuration and evaluation of Melita On-line Object Monitoring Service (MOOMS): an on-line monitoring service for distributed object-oriented applications. As MOOMS is in many aspects similar to the Java Management Extensions (JMX) framework, the presented evaluation may shed some light on how this class of object services may be developed and used with efficiency in mind.

AB To face the challenges resulting from increasing complexity of portable consumer electronics, a dependability framework to improve the availability of application software in runtime is needed. In this paper, a system layer division based on the user event processing is given and faults are classified based on it. A hardware software co-designed application aware framework architecture proposed to handle these types of faults. And the software components on different layer are provided with separate service to improve the availability. A validation based on software-implemented fault injection is also given to evaluate the performance. And the experiment results show that the framework can achieve high coverage and fast error recovery.

AB Digital twin (DT) framework is introduced in the context of application for power grid online analysis. In the development process of a new power grid real-time online analysis system, an online analysis digital twin (OADT) has been implemented to realize the new online analysis architecture. The OADT approach is presented and its prominent features are discussed. The presentation, discussion, and performance testing are based on a large-scale grid network model (40K+ buses), exported directly from the EMS system of an actual power grid. A plan to apply the OADT approach to digitize power grid dispatching rules is also outlined.

AB Highly probabilistic, potential, and dynamic domains are only relatively known to contribute classical techniques for complex system establishment impossible. Currently available technologies and strategies do not adequately address these novel needs. Thus, by enabling autonomous systems to adapt, decision-making and learning abilities, we can empower them with sufficient and appropriate expertise to recognize and address such issues. To address these requirements, discrete event-driven systems (DEDS) have been developed. This system can help the technologists of future autonomous systems by simulating the effect of auxiliary designs on the performance of the autonomous system. For modeling regular feedback of performance that is influenced by traditional techniques and depends on trust, the discrete event-driven method is most suited. This paper describes the DEDS system, the modeling of this system, and as well as the supervisory control system by explaining the supervisor, and partial supervisor. A comprehensive literature survey has been carried out in this article to explain the controllability, diagnosability, and observability potential of the DEDS system for various applications. Some of the major areas of applications such as healthcare, logistics, robotics, and banking sectors, have been discussed. Also, we have explained this system with the help of modeling a discrete event system for a queuing problem associated with robotics tasks as an example by the simulation with MATLAB 2022a. Lastly, the possible future research directions in the DEDS advancement have been provided.

DE autonomous agents; meta-modeling; complex event processing; event-driven
   software systems
AB AFRL cognitive scientists are struggling to develop cognitive process models that behave more like autonomous goal-pursuing agents than programs. Autonomous agents are difficult to develop because the broader system in which contingencies and effective actions mesh must be represented and processed by the agent. In complex and dynamic environments, it is virtually impossible to author a set of pre-defined rules capturing all the relationships between contingencies, constraints, and effective actions. For the last three years, an AFRL Large-Scale Cognitive Modeling (LSCM) research initiative has worked to develop new agent specification formalisms that decrease the importance of pre-defined rules. The initiative has also developed execution frameworks for these formalisms that reduce the difficulty of integrating autonomous agents into training and operational environments built upon complex event-driven software systems. During this address, I will describe how the LSCM initiative has used meta-modeling in the Generic Modeling Environment and agent execution in a "cognitively enhanced" complex event processing architecture to fundamentally change the way cognitive models and agents are conceived of, specified, and executed. The address will demonstrate how these changes help AFRL cognitive scientists specify autonomous agents and integrate them into complex event-driven software systems.

TI An Event Calculus for Event Recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
DT Article
DE Event pattern matching; event processing; action language
AB Systems for symbolic event recognition accept as input a stream of time-stamped events from sensors and other computational devices, and seek to identify high-level composite events, collections of events that satisfy some pattern. RTEC is an Event Calculus dialect with novel implementation and 'windowing' techniques that allow for efficient event recognition, scalable to large data streams. RTEC supports the expression of rather complex events, such as 'two people are fighting', using simple primitives. It can operate in the absence of filtering modules, as it is only slightly affected by data that are irrelevant to the events we want to recognise. Furthermore, RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a (variable) delay from, and are revised by, the underlying sources. RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision. We evaluate RTEC both theoretically, presenting a complexity analysis, and experimentally, using two real-world applications. The evaluation shows that RTEC can support real-time event recognition and is capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in a survey of event processing use cases.

AB Most of the IoT applications are distributed in nature generating large data streams which have to be analyzed in near real-time. Solutions based on Complex Event Processing (CEP) have the potential to extract high-level knowledge from these data streams but the use of CEP for distributed IoT applications is still in early phase and involves many drawbacks. The manual setting of rules for CEP is one of the major drawback. These rules are based on threshold values and currently there are no automatic methods to find the optimized threshold values. In real-time dynamic IoT environments, the context of the application is always changing and the performance of current CEP solutions are not reliable for such scenarios. In this regard, we propose an automatic and context aware method based on clustering for finding optimized threshold values for CEP rules. We have developed a lightweight CEP called mu CEP to run on low processing hardware which can update the rules on the run. We have demonstrated our approach using a real-world use case of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to detect congestion in near real-time.

ID CACHE
AB To support reactive and predictive applications, complex event processing (CEP) systems detect patterns in event streams based on predefined queries. To determine the events that constitute a query match, their payload data may need to be assessed together with data from remote sources. Such dependencies are problematic, since waiting for remote data to be fetched interrupts the processing of the stream. Yet, without event selection based on remote data, the query state to maintain may grow exponentially. In either case, the performance of the CEP system degrades drastically.
   To tackle these issues, we present EIRES, a framework for efficient integration of static data from remote sources in CEP. It employs a cost-model to determine when to fetch certain remote data elements and how long to keep them in a cache for future use. EIRES combines strategies for (i) prefetching that queries remote data based on anticipated use and (ii) lazy evaluation that postpones the event selection based on remote data without interrupting the stream processing. Our experiments indicate that the combination of these strategies improves the latency of query evaluation by up to 3,752x for synthetic data and 47x for real-world data.

AB One of the main advantages brought by the Internet of Things (IoT) is the possibility of having large amounts of data from several sources that allow us, once analyzed, to make decisions in various domains in real time. This implies the need to be able to process large volumes of data in more or less limited processing times depending on the application domain. In this sense, complex event processing (CEP), used in conjunction with an enterprise service bus (ESB), has proven to be very efficient in multiple domains. In search for greater efficiency, some CEP engines offer the option of using flow-based programming (FBP) rather than their traditional programming using CEP together with an event bus. However, its use, while it may be more efficient, can lead to other limitations. In this article, we analyze and describe the performance and limitations of using a CEP engine with an ESB versus a CEP engine with FBP. This will allow developers to decide which option is more convenient for their IoT system depending on the application domain and its specific needs.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) and Reactive Languages (RLs) are examples of solutions for the so-called reactive applications. Such applications are designed to detect and react to changes or event occurrences as they happen in a timely fashion. Both CEP and RLs have been developed by different communities, yet some researchers agree that they share certain aspects and could perhaps be integrated. With that in mind, we developed a JavaScript library called CEP.js that leverages the well-known Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) to offer not only general-purpose stream operations but also CEP ones. The fact of being a JavaScript library allows CEP.js to be used in Web applications and easily embedded into mobile applications. Therefore, it opens many possibilities for CEP in mobile client applications. It also raises the concern of energy efficiency since CEP applications commonly have to deal with a significant number of events, and its continuous operations on data flows may incur significant processing. Even though CEP.js has been designed after RxJS, it was conceived in a loosely coupled way that the underlying reactive library should be easily replaced if needed. In addition to presenting the CEP.js library, in this paper, we investigate if there is any significant change in performance by running an experiment where the replacement of the reactive library used in CEP.js is the main factor analyzed. The experiment was executed in different Android devices, focusing specifically on energy consumption, an essential non-functional requirement in the smartphone realm.

AB The ATLAS experiment has successfully integrated HighPerformance Computing resources (HPCs) in its production system. Unlike the current generation of HPC systems, and the LHC computing grid, the next generation of supercomputers is expected to be extremely heterogeneous in nature: different systems will have radically different architectures, and most of them will provide partitions optimized for different kinds of workloads. In this work we explore the applicability of concepts and tools realized in Ray (the high-performance distributed execution framework targeting large-scale machine learning applications) to ATLAS event throughput optimization on heterogeneous distributed resources, ranging from traditional grid clusters to Exascale computers. We present a prototype of Raythena, a Ray-based implementation of the ATLAS Event Service (AES), a fine-grained event processing workflow aimed at improving the efficiency of ATLAS workflows on opportunistic resources, specifically HPCs. The AES is implemented as an event processing task farm that distributes packets of events to several worker processes running on multiple nodes. Each worker in the task farm runs an event-processing application (Athena) as a daemon. The whole system is orchestrated by Ray, which assigns work in a distributed, possibly heterogeneous, environment.
   For all its flexibility, the AES implementation is currently comprised of multiple separate layers that communicate through ad-hoc command-line and filebased interfaces. The goal of Raythena is to integrate these layers through a feature-rich, efficient application framework. Besides increasing usability and robustness, a vertically integrated scheduler will enable us to explore advanced concepts such as dynamically shaping of workflows to exploit currently available resources, particularly on heterogeneous systems.

AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful paradigm for scalable data management that is employed in many real-world scenarios such as detecting credit card fraud in banks. The so-called complex events are expressed using a specification language that is typically implemented and executed on a specific runtime system. While the tight coupling of these two components has been regarded as the key for supporting CEP at high performance, such dependencies pose several inherent challenges as follows. (1) Application development atop a CEP system requires extensive knowledge of how the runtime system operates, which is typically highly complex in nature. (2) The specification language dependence requires the need of domain experts and further restricts and steepens the learning curve for application developers.
   In this paper, we propose CEPLESS, a scalable data management system that decouples the specification from the runtime system by building on the principles of serverless computing. CEPLESS provides "operator as a service" and offers flexibility by enabling the development of CEP application in any specification language while abstracting away the complexity of the CEP runtime system. As part of CEPLESS, we designed and evaluated novel mechanisms for in-memory processing and batching that enable the stateful processing of CEP operators even under high rates of ingested events. Our evaluation demonstrates that CEPLESS can be easily integrated into existing CEP systems like Apache Flink while attaining similar throughput under high scale of events (up to 100K events per second) and dynamic operator update in (similar to)238 ms.

AB The ATLAS experiment records proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC accelerator. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects interesting events on-line in a three-level trigger system in order to store them at a budgeted rate of several hundred Hz.
   This paper focuses on the TDAQ data-logging system and in particular on the implementation and performance of a novel parallel software design. The main challenge presented by a parallel data-logging implementation is the conflict between the largely parallel nature of the event processing, especially the recently introduced event compression, and the constraint of sequential file writing and hash-sum evaluation. This is further complicated by the necessity of operating in a fully data-driven mode, to cope with continuously evolving trigger and detector configurations.
   In this paper we report on the design of the new ATLAS on-line storage software. In particular we will discuss our development experience using recent concurrency-oriented libraries. Finally we will show the new system performance with respect to the old, single-threaded software design.

AB Low-latency stream processing applications (SPA) distribute the event streams on parallel instances of the application's operators to avoid queuing. Each operator has a set of processing nodes for its instances.Edge and fog infrastructures promise, among other things, low communication latency and are thus of interest for low-latency SPAs. Yet, they include heterogeneous, even volatile nodes which makes the parallel processing of SPAs challengingAvailable solutions for parallel SPAs often assume homogeneity and stable infrastructures.Thus, we aim to balance the stream processing among heterogeneous, instable infrastructures using a decentralized control mechanism. We propose a decentralized, dynamic, and lightweight approach to re-balance SPA-load according to the nodes current performance, while minimizing latencies. In doing so, we introduce the Coda-EFC framework for window-based stream processing on heterogeneous distributed infrastructures. It dynamically adapts its load balancing to node performance without computing quickly outdated schedules and aims for latency-optimal load balancing. We introduce two adaptive load balancing strategiesone tailored for heterogeneous, dynamic infrastructures, the other an adaptation of a state-of-the art approach.

AB Many modern applications including tag based mass transit systems, RFID-based supply chain management systems and online financial feeds require special purpose event stream processing technology to analyze vast amounts of sequential multi-dimensional data available in real-time data feeds. Traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are not designed for real-time pattern-based operations, while Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems are designed for sequence detection and do not support OLAP operations. We will demonstrate a novel E-Cube model that combines CEP and OLAP techniques for multi-dimensional event pattern analysis at different abstraction levels. A London transit scenario will be given to demonstrate the utility and performance of this proposed technology.

AB This study employed a short-term prospective design to examine the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal on the effect of post-event processing on social anxiety and maladaptive beliefs. A sample of 510 participants (323 women; mean age=20.8years, SD=1.5) was assessed twice (T1 and T2), with a two-month interval between assessments. Participants completed questionnaires regarding social anxiety, maladaptive beliefs, post-event processing, cognitive reappraisal, and negative interpersonal life events. Results showed that cognitive reappraisal attenuated the effect of post-event processing on social anxiety in participants who had experienced relatively fewer negative life events between assessments. On the other hand, this effect was not clearly observed in participants who had experienced relatively more negative life events. These findings demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation strategies and experienced negative life events as well as PEP in individuals with social anxiety.

AB A novel micro-kernel approach to building parallel/distributed simulation systems is presented. Using this approach, a unified system architecture is developed for incorporating, multiple types of simulation processes. The processes hold potential to employ a variety of synchronization mechanisms, and could even alter their choice of mechanism dynamically. Supported mechanisms include traditional lookahead-based conservative and state saving-based optimistic execution approaches. Also supported are newer mechanisms such as reverse computation-based optimistic execution and aggregation-based event processing, all within a single parsimonious application programming interface. The internal implementation and a preliminary performance evaluation of this interface are presented in mu sik, which is an efficient parallel/distributed realization of the microkernel architecture in C++.

AB In a context of e-government, there are usually regulatory compliance requirements that the supporting systems should enforce. To this end, an appropriate processing of data coming from different sources is required, which presents an important challenge given the large volume of data that egovernment systems handle. This volume of data is also increased with data coming from autonomous sensors (e. g. reporting carbon emission in protected areas) and from citizens providing information (e. g. illegal dumping) in a voluntary way. Complex Event Processing (CEP) technologies allow processing large amount of event data and detecting patterns from them. However, they do not provide support for geographic information which is essential for monitoring and controlling regulations which apply to specific geographical areas. This paper proposes a geospatial extension for CEP that allows monitoring environmental factors considering the geographic location of the processed data.

AB Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) can take advantage of the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and the proactive event-driven computing paradigm for fully exploiting its capabilities by enabling proactive maintenance decisions ahead of time. In this paper, proactive event-driven computing is used as a lever in order to provide a holistic CBM approach along with an information system for generating proactive maintenance recommendations. Since the Detect and the Predict phases of the "Detect-Predict-Decide-Act" proactivity principle as applied to the CBM framework are well-studied fields in literature, the focus of the current research is on the Decide phase that is still an unexplored area. Therefore, in the context of this paper, the approach, contributing decision methods and technical specifications of an associated information system are defined and developed for this phase. The proposed approach is implemented in an information system, which is deployed and evaluated in the context of two real industrial scenarios in the area of oil and gas and automotive lighting equipment industries. The results of a comparative and a sensitivity evaluation analysis show that the proposed approach can enable industrial business transformation from a reactive to a proactive mode of operation, in order to eliminate maintenance-related losses and optimize business performance.

AB Scalable multithreading poses challenges to I/O for the ATLAS experiment. The performance of a thread-safe I/O strategy may depend upon many factors, including I/O latencies, whether tasks are CPU- or I/O-intensive, and thread count. In a multithreaded framework, an I/O infrastructure must efficiently supply event data to and collect it from many threads processing multiple events in flight. In particular, on-demand reading from multiple threads may challenge caching strategies that were developed for serial processing and may need to be enhanced. This I/O infrastructure must also address how to read, make available, and propagate in-file metadata and other non-event data needed as context for event processing. We describe the design and scheduling of I/O components in the ATLAS multithreaded control framework, AthenaMT, for both event and non-event I/O. We discuss issues associated with exploiting the multithreading capabilities of our underlying persistence technology, ROOT, in a manner harmonious with the ATLAS framework?s own approach to thread management. Finally, we discuss opportunities for evolution and simplification of I/O components that have successfully supported ATLAS event processing for many years from their serial incarnations to their thread-safe counterparts.

AB The fuzzy discrete event system theory is unique in that it is capable of modeling a class of event-driven systems as fuzzy automata with states and event-invoked state transitions being ambiguous. At present, the theory lacks a self-learning component, an important topic that has hardly been touched in the literature. In this article, we use stochastic gradient descent to develop online learning algorithms for the fuzzy automata. We uncover an inherent obstacle in the initial derived algorithms that fundamentally restricts their learning capability owing to dependences of the model parameters to be learned. We develop a novel mechanism to not only overcome the obstacle but also make the learning adaptive. Our final algorithms can learn an event transition matrix based on automaton's states before and after the occurrence of a fuzzy event, and learn the transition matrix and multidimensional Gaussian fuzzy sets yielding initial automaton states from relevant input variables and target states. Computer simulation results are presented to show learning performance of the final algorithms.

AB The paper introduces a testing solution for evaluating Ambient Assisted Living systems by means of 3D simulations generated with a game engine, complex event processing, and classifiers. The solution aims to ensure that: (1) some key features of the problem appear in the simulation, and (2) the assistive solution interacts with the persons in the right way. A specific testing solution is needed because of the evolving nature of the simulation (each iteration of the requirements specification involves changes in the activities within the simulation) and the assistive solution (it operates in real time and evaluating its performance may require manually inspecting hours of simulation). The approach is illustrated with a proof-of-concept experiment.

AB Air pollution is one of the influential problems threatening the environment and human health today. Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive systems for proactive decisions in solving this problem. Since the prediction of air pollution depends on several complicated factors such as the accuracy of meteorology reports, air pollution accumulation, traffic flow, and industrial emissions, the contribution of historical or real-time predictions to the solution of the problem is limited. To address the existing limitations, we propose a novel AI-powered and Fog-based predictive complex event processing system (CepAIr) for the prediction of future air pollution rates. CepAIr predicts the future air quality of pollutant gases using RNN, LSTM, CNN, and SVR models. Then, it sends the prediction results to decision-makers in an understandable format, enabling them to take proactive actions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the CepAIr with SVR and DL models. Additionally, we examine CepAIr in terms of end-to-end network delay and measure its impact on the network. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CepAIr predicts future pollutant gas concentrations with DL models (especially with CNN) with a high success rate while guaranteeing minimum end-to-end network delay.

AB The conjunction operator can be augmented with temporal constraints to define an arbitrary pattern of events in event stream processing (ESP). However, using temporal constraints to specify patterns can be complex. This research has defined an operator hierarchy, where the top of the hierarchy defines the conjunction operator and the leaves of the hierarchy define more specific semantics associated with a sequence of events. The use of the specialized operators simplifies pattern expression and make the sequence semantics clear. Furthermore, in an experimental study, patterns using operators from the hierarchy outperform patterns expressed using the conjunction operator with temporal constraints in run time performance, further validating the usefulness of the operator hierarchy.

ID SAFETY
AB This paper presents a realtime, collision-free motion coordination and navigation system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleet. The proposed system uses geographical locations of the UAVs and of the successfully detected, static and moving obstacles to predict and avoid: (1) UAV-to-UAV collisions, (2) UAV-to-static-obstacle collisions, and (3) UAV-to-moving-obstacle collisions. Our collision prediction approach leverages efficient runtime monitoring and Complex Event Processing (CEP) to make timely predictions. A distinctive feature of the proposed system is its ability to foresee a risk of a collision in realtime and proactively find best ways to avoid the predicted collisions in order to ensure safety of the entire fleet. We also present a simulation-based implementation of the proposed system along with an experimental evaluation involving a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed system successfully predicts and avoids all three kinds of collisions in realtime. Moreover, it generates efficient UAV routes, has an excellent runtime performance, efficiently scales to large sized problem instances involving dozens of UAVs and obstacles, and is suitable for some densely populated, cluttered flying zones.

AB Background and objectives: Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) paradigms targeting anxiety aim to reduce attentional biases for threatening stimuli and thereby reduce anxiety. Based on cognitive theories of performance and learning, elevated levels of arousal during ABM might enhance its effectiveness by making training more engaging and activating fear schemas. This study investigated whether elevated levels of arousal during ABM would increase its effectiveness in reducing attentional bias, stress reactivity, and post-event processing.
   Method: We randomly assigned 79 high socially anxious students to a session of ABM or control training preceded by either a social stress or control induction to manipulate arousal. Training outcomes were attentional bias, stress reactivity, and post-event processing. Subjective arousal was assessed before, during, and after training.
   Results: Results indicated that ABM was not successful in reducing attentional bias, stress reactivity or post-event processing, and that the effects of ABM were not moderated by subjective arousal. There was a trend towards ABM being more effective than control training in reducing attentional bias directly after training when participants were more aroused. However, this effect was not maintained one day after the training.
   Limitations: The arousal manipulation did not result in significant between-group differences in subjective arousal.
   Conclusions: This study did not provide support for the moderating role of arousal in ABM training effects. Replications with more effective mood induction procedures and more power are needed as a trend finding was observed suggesting that higher levels of arousal improved the direct ABM effects on attentional bias.

ID PET DETECTORS
AB We present a high speed implementation of maximum-likelihood estimator using FPGA as positioning method for monolithic scintillation crystal based PET detector. Instead of using channel distribution parameters to recalculate the fitting curves, we suggest using real possibility distribution function for channels of all possible positions, which largely reduces the requirement of computation resources (e.g. on-chip DSP). With optimization of subordinate regions of these distributions, the whole storage requirement are trimmed to no more than one-fourth as before without loss of performance compared to an off-line implementation. The simplified hardware structure makes a tight pipelined structure possible that the event processing rate can be 25M events per second with the main clock at 200M Hz.

AB Energy Intelligence platforms can help organizations manage power consumption more efficiently by providing a functional view of the entire organization so that the energy consumption of business activities can be understood, changed, and reinvented to better support sustainable practices. Significant technical challenges exist in terms of information management, cross-domain data integration, leveraging real-time data, and assisting users to interpret the information to optimize energy usage. This paper presents an architectural approach to overcome these challenges using a Dataspace, Linked Data, and Complex Event Processing. The paper describes the fundamentals of the approach and demonstrates it within an Enterprise Energy Observatory.

TI Detecting security attacks in cyber-physical systems: a comparison of
   Mule and WSO2 intelligent IoT architectures

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm keeps growing, and many different IoT devices, such as smartphones and smart appliances, are extensively used in smart industries and smart cities. The benefits of this paradigm are obvious, but these IoT environments have brought with them new challenges, such as detecting and combating cybersecurity attacks against cyber-physical systems. This paper addresses the real-time detection of security attacks in these IoT systems through the combined used of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Complex Event Processing (CEP). In this regard, in the past we proposed an intelligent architecture that integrates ML with CEP, and which permits the definition of event patterns for the real-time detection of not only specific IoT security attacks, but also novel attacks that have not previously been defined. Our current concern, and the main objective of this paper, is to ensure that the architecture is not necessarily linked to specific vendor technologies and that it can be implemented with other vendor technologies while maintaining its correct functionality. We also set out to evaluate and compare the performance and benefits of alternative implementations. This is why the proposed architecture has been implemented by using technologies from different vendors: firstly, the Mule Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) together with the Esper CEP engine; and secondly, the WSO2 ESB with the Siddhi CEP engine. Both implementations have been tested in terms of performance and stress, and they are compared and discussed in this paper. The results obtained demonstrate that both implementations are suitable and effective, but also that there are notable differences between them: the Mule-based architecture is faster when the architecture makes use of two message broker topics and compares different types of events, while the WSO2-based one is faster when there is a single topic and one event type, and the system has a heavy workload.

AB The CMS experiment is one of the large experiments at the LHC at CERN. The CMS online data quality monitoring (DQM) system comprises a number of software components for the distribution, processing and visualization of event data. Already before the year 2010 the system had been successfully developed, deployed and operated in previous data challenges with cosmic ray muons and LHC beams. In preparation for the LHC data taking period of 2010, the performance and efficiency of the infrastructure was evaluated and a number of improvements were implemented with the goal to improve the robustness and data throughput of the system and to minimize the operation and maintenance effort. In this report the main considerations and achieved improvements are described.

AB Real-time, discrete event simulation often employs a simulation model that interacts with a surrounding environment, such as software components, hardware components or human operators. In such simulation, a simulator must interact with its environment such that events from its environment should be processed in a timeliness manner. Simulation methodologies developed for non-interactive simulation, such as performance simulation, do not have such capabilities in event processing. We propose a real-time, interactive simulation methodology which concurrently executes real-time DEVS(RT-DEVS) models and its environment in a time selective manner. The methodology is implemented in an object-oriented environment by using multi-thread facilities running on a multi-thread OS.

AB Three experiments examined the mechanisms by which downward shifts in reinforcer value influence learning in appetitive unblocking procedures. The downward shift was accomplished by omitting the 2nd of a 2-reinforcer sequence (food-food or food-sucrose). Performance of normal rats was compared with that of rats with lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala, which are thought to interfere with surprise-induced enhancements of event processing. The results suggested that, in normal rats, omission of the 2nd reinforcer enhanced processing of the 1st reinforcer rather than processing of the conditioned stimuli and that lesions of the central nucleus eliminated this enhancement. The roles of reinforcement error signals in conditioning are discussed.

AB The design of an RTOS (real-time operation system) kernel is mostly based on a preemptive scheduler that responds to events and interrupts according to the priorities. The hardware RTOS (HW-RTOS) concept includes a real-time scheduler which ensures a deterministic execution of a set of tasks by implementing in hardware the appropriate scheduling algorithms, similar to those of the RTOS. The contributions of this paper consist in presenting original methods that contribute to increasing the performance of the RTOS, to reduce the jitter effect by implementing a unified space of task and event priorities, to increase the execution factor and controlling the RTS (real-time system) scheduling limit, by implementing the real-time event handling unit.

AB The best performing learning algorithms devised for event cameras work by first converting events into dense representations that are then processed using standard CNNs. However, these steps discard both the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events, leading to high computational burden and latency. For this reason, recent works have adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which process events as "static" spatio-temporal graphs, which are inherently "sparse". We take this trend one step further by introducing Asynchronous, Event-based Graph Neural Networks (AEGNNs), a novel event-processing paradigm that generalizes standard GNNs to process events as "evolving" spatio-temporal graphs. AEGNNs follow efficient update rules that restrict recomputation of network activations only to the nodes affected by each new event, thereby significantly reducing both computation and latency for eventby-event processing. AEGNNs are easily trained on synchronous inputs and can be converted to efficient, "asynchronous" networks at test time. We thoroughly validate our method on object classification and detection tasks, where we show an up to a 200-fold reduction in computational complexity (FLOPs), with similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art asynchronous methods. This reduction in computation directly translates to an 8fold reduction in computational latency when compared to standard GNNs, which opens the door to low-latency eventbased processing.

AB The combination of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) is gaining momentum for event centric management and processing of information in complex distributed systems (e. g., business automation). Whereas systems for factory automation have traditionally been deployed using dedicated buses and proprietary (often scan based) protocols, a recent trend in process automation is towards adopting open internet based technologies and event based communication. This trend is driven by the increasing number and capabilities of devices used for monitoring and control, and the increased flexibility, maintainability and price/performance gains expected from IP (potentially SOA/CEP) enabled systems.
   In this paper we discuss the challenges involved to apply SOA and CEP to the field of factory automation. In particular, real-time aspects are highlighted, both w.r.t. to accurate time-stamping of physical events in a distributed system, as well as end-to-end timing including communication and CEP processing.
   We approach the challenges by an architecture combining state-of-the-art synchronisation mechanisms for wired and wireless networks together with real-time communication and distributed query processing based on the notion of time constrained reactions. We discuss the impact of synchronisation inaccuracies and delays introduced by processing and communication, and present a method for implementation of safe potential-and certain matches.

AB The next-generation 5G mobile networks are expected to bring a major shift on the management paradigm based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) compared with its precursor, 4G. Consequently, operators need to significantly change their network architectures, management mechanisms and business models to accommodate and address the 5G challenges. This paper contributes to advancing the operators' management capabilities in the monitoring and analytic domains, looking at the evolution of the existing performance management platform from a leading operator to a new SDN/NFV-enabled platform, in the context of the EU 5G project SELFNET. This work focuses on designing and prototyping the essential functionalities to perform real-time processing over network infrastructure data. This work devises a new Complex Event Processing (CEP) framework, a real-time framework for processing and aggregating big data using a dynamic rule-based approach. This CEP framework has been successfully implemented and deployed, with aggregation rules applied to a Self-Protection use case, which is able to provide in real-time information about detected botnets in the network. From a high-level perspective, this work brings some new understanding about the role of SDN/NFV network management tools for 5G network operators.

AB The last few years, the generation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data with different velocity and veracity and the requirement to process them, has significantly challenged the computational capacity and efficiency of the modern infrastructural resources. The propagation of Big Data among different processing and storage architectures, has amplified the need for adequate and cost-efficient infrastructures to host them. An overabundance of cloud service offerings is currently available and is being rapidly adopted by small and medium enterprises based on its many benefits to traditional computing models. However, at the same time the Big Data computing requirements pose new research challenges that question the adoption of single cloud provider resources. Nowadays, we discuss the emerging data-intensive applications that necessitate the wide adoption of multicloud deployment models, in order to use all the advantages of cloud computing. A key tool for managing such multicloud applications and guarantying their quality of service, even in extreme scenarios of workload fluctuations, are adequate distributed monitoring mechanisms. In this work, we discuss a distributed complex event processing architecture that follows automatically the big data application deployment in order to efficiently monitor its health status and detect reconfiguration opportunities. This proposal is examined against an illustrative scenario and is preliminary evaluated for revealing its performance results.

AB Radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled retail store management needs workflow optimization to facilitate real-time decision making. In this paper, complex event processing (CEP) based RFID-enabled retail store management is studied, particularly focusing on automated shelf replenishment decisions. We define different types of event queries to describe retailer store workflow action over the RFID data streams on multiple tagging levels (e.g., item level and container level). Non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) based evaluation models are used to detect event patterns. To manage pattern match results in the process of event detection, optimization algorithm is applied in the event model to share event detection results. A simulated RFID-enabled retail store is used to verify the effectiveness of the method, experiment results show that the algorithm is effective and could optimize retail store management workflow.

AB The emerging event cameras have the potential to be an excellent complement for standard cameras within various visual tasks, especially in illumination-changing environments or situations requiring high-temporal resolution. Herein, an event-based stereo visual odometry (VO) system via adaptive time-surface (TS) and truncated signed distance function (TSDF), namely, T-ESVO, is proposed . The system consists of three carefully designed components, including the event processing unit, the mapping unit, and the tracking unit. Specifically, the event processing unit adopts a novel spatial-temporal adaptive TS that can deal with different camera motions in various environments. The mapping unit introduces the TSDF to describe the 3D representation of environments and achieves depth estimation based on the global historical depth information contained in the environmental TSDF description. The tracking unit achieves the 6-DoF pose estimation through an 3D-2D registration method based on the left/right TS selection mechanism and the depth point selection mechanism. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system are evaluated on various datasets, and the experimental results show that T-ESVO achieves good performance in both accuracy and robustness when compared with other state-of-the-art event-based stereo VO systems.

AB With the prevalence of multicore processors in computer systems, many soft real-time applications, such as media-based ones, use parallel programming models to utilize hardware resources better and possibly shorten response time. Meanwhile, virtualization technology is widely used in cloud data centers. More and more cloud services including such parallel soft real-time applications are running in virtualized environment. However, current hypervisors do not provide adequate support for them because of soft real-time constraints and synchronization problems, which result in frequent deadline misses and serious performance degradation. CPU schedulers in underlying hypervisors are central to these issues.
   In this paper, we identify and analyze CPU scheduling problems in hypervisors, and propose a novel scheduling algorithm considering both soft real-time constraints and synchronization problems. In our proposed method, real-time priority is introduced to accelerate event processing of parallel soft real-time applications, and dynamic time slice is used to schedule virtual CPUs. Besides, all runnable virtual CPUs of virtual machines running parallel soft real-time applications are scheduled simultaneously to address synchronization problems. We implement a parallel soft real-time scheduler, named Poris, based on Xen. Our evaluation shows Poris can significantly improve the performance of parallel soft real-time applications. For example, compared to the Credit scheduler, Poris improves the performance of media player by up to a factor of 1.35, and shortens the execution time of PARSEC benchmark by up to 44.12%.

AB Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources, such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive deep neural network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes. This article presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching. VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video inference process across nodes. This article proposes a novel content-driven microbatch resizing, query-aware caching, and microbatch-based utility filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive evaluations are performed over five real-world data sets. The experimental results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves similar to 2.3x higher throughput with minimal latency and similar to 99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds.

DE SIEM; event correlation; complex event processing
AB SIEM (Software Information and Event Management) systems are becoming increasingly commonplace in scenarios as diverse as ICT environments or Critical infrastructures, providing the means to process and analyse multiple distributed sources of information and events, for auditing or security purposes. The main component of its architecture is the correlation engine, which is used to normalize, reduce, filter and aggregate events from a set of heterogeneous inputs. Other modules of SIEM systems include agents for data acquisition, reporting modules for event notification, and storage components for log and auditing purposes. From a cyber-security standpoint, correlators play a vital role in SIEM architectures, providing the means to infer security information from existing event sources such as security agents or services and device logs. In this perspective, correlator performance is a very relevant matter, as it needs to process large amounts of inputs, while having to provide fast results (i.e. security event notifications). Despite the existence of several correlation engines, there is a scarcity of published work comparing their characteristics and performance, a gap this paper addresses. This paper presents the concept of SIEM systems and correlation engines, providing a description of their architecture and functional characteristics, with a focus on some of the most popular open source rule-based correlation engines, such as the Simple Event Correlator (SEC), Esper, Nodebrain and Drools. It also provides a comparative performance evaluation of these correlation engines, based on experimental results.

   Service Provenance
AB In general, provenance describes the origin and well-documented history of a given object. This notion has been applied in information systems, mainly to provide data provenance of scientific workflows. Similar to this, provenance in Service-oriented Computing has also focused on data provenance. However, the authors argue that in service-centric systems the origin and history of services is equally important. This paper presents an approach that addresses service provenance. The authors show how service provenance information can be collected and retrieved, and how security mechanisms guarantee integrity and access to this information, while also providing user-specific views on provenance. Finally, the paper gives a performance evaluation of the authors' approach, which has been integrated into the VRESCo Web service runtime environment.

AB The inner part of the BESIII drift chamber is expected to be replaced with a cylindrical GEM (CGEM) tracker in summer 2020. Despite providing generally similar performance to a currently installed inner drift chamber, it may improve tracking of the low-momentum charged particles, which is strongly affected by the beam-induced background. Moreover, it can be considered as testing ground for trackers in proposed high event rate experiments as super c-tau factories. For high background and high multiplicity events, the application of advanced neural network track reconstruction methods can provide gains both in tracking efficiency and reconstruction time. Here the very first step, namely primary event processing for the BESIII CGEM subdetector, which involves cluster finding and 3d-coordinate hit reconstruction, is considered.

ID INTERNET; SYSTEMS; ENGINE; THINGS
AB In recent decades, data aggregation and correlation have emerged as a significant and challenging area of research for finding useful relationships between different features of streaming data. Similarly, complex event processing (CEP) has emerged as a vital tool for aggregating and finding patterns from streaming data such as video streaming, real-time stock trades, sensor data and more. In this context, rule-based classifier algorithms are widely employed to discover valuable patterns from streaming data and cause-and-effect relationships between events. However, streaming data is dynamic and complex in nature, and it is not feasible to update the rules manually by domain experts continuously. On the contrary, dynamic data sometimes fails to adopt rules, which leads to sub optimal CEP implementation. Rule-based CEP systems come up with their own set of challenges, which primarily includes rules adaptability for streaming IoT data. In dynamic environment, shifting patterns in data streams can impact the performance of the CEP system, as well as the correlation between events, and finding useful patterns is very much challenging. In this article, our objective is to provide a comprehensive survey for CEP using rule-based algorithms applied across various domain and applications. We present a broad literature review using a sequential expansion of methods used for CEP, which primarily include event producers, preprocessing of events, robust rule implementation, and decision support. Additionally, we present a detailed classification of approaches used for different applications. Finally, after applying the rigorous review, it was feasible to present the state-of-the-art research, which focuses on designing robust rules, application specific insights, scalable event-driven architectures and finding the domain's trends with significant challenges and future scope.

AB The traditional corporate financial diagnosis method is susceptible to the choice of accounting policies, and there are serious lags, one-sidedness and limitations. A financial management information system based on improved genetic algorithm is proposed based on the financial management information system data mining and clustering analysis model framework, and based on the financial analysis related knowledge. By adopting the event-driven architecture, a financial management information system model based on data mining technology is constructed, which not only enables the data warehouse and data mining technology to play a role in decision support, but also enables the financial information and non-financial information of enterprises to be fully utilized. By extracting financial data, using the above decision tree classification algorithm for data mining, classifying tests according to subject categories and business processes, and evaluating the accuracy of the prediction results, and then determining whether the classification algorithm is selected. The test and analysis of the national tax financial analysis system were completed, and three public data sets and three national tax financial expenditure data sets were selected, and the algorithm was tested on the experimental platform. The test results show that the algorithm show good performance for large-scale data sets, especially financial expenditure data sets, and the test accuracy rate is not only stable but also maintains a relatively high range.

AB Detecting complex patterns in event streams, i.e., complex event processing (CEP), has become increasingly important for modern enterprises to react quickly to critical situations. In many practical cases business events are generated based on pre-defined business logics. Hence constraints, such as occurrence and order constraints, often hold among events. Reasoning using these known constraints enables us to predict the non-occurrences of certain future events, thereby helping us to identify and then terminate the long running query processes that are guaranteed to not lead to successful matches.
   In this work, we focus on exploiting event constraints to optimize CEP over large volumes of business transaction streams. Since the optimization opportunities arise at runtime, we develop a runtime query unsatisfiability (RunSAT) checking technique that detects optimal points for terminating query evaluation. To assure efficiency of RunSAT checking, we propose mechanisms to precompute the query failure conditions to be checked at runtime. This guarantees a constant-time RunSAT reasoning cost, making our technique highly scalable. We realize our optimal query termination strategies by augmenting the query with Event-Condition-Action rules encoding the pre-computed failure conditions. This results in an event processing solution compatible with state-of-the-art CEP architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that significant performance gains are achieved, while the optimization overhead is small.

AB The ATLAS experiment has successfully used its Gaudi/Athena software framework for data taking and analysis during the first LHC run, with billions of events successfully processed. However, the design of Gaudi/Athena dates from early 2000 and the software and the physics code has been written using a single threaded, serial design. This programming model has increasing difficulty in exploiting the potential of current CPUs, which offer their best performance only through taking full advantage of multiple cores and wide vector registers. Future CPU evolution will intensify this trend, with core counts increasing and memory per core falling. Maximising performance per watt will be a key metric, so all of these cores must be used as efficiently as possible. In order to address the deficiencies of the current framework, ATLAS has embarked upon two projects: first, a practical demonstration of the use of multi-threading in our reconstruction software, using the GaudiHive framework; second, an exercise to gather requirements for an updated framework, going back to the first principles of how event processing occurs. In this paper we report on both these aspects of our work. For the hive based demonstrators, we discuss what changes were necessary in order to allow the serially designed ATLAS code to run, both to the framework and to the tools and algorithms used. We report on what general lessons were learned about the code patterns that had been employed in the software and which patterns were identified as particularly problematic for multi-threading. These lessons were fed into our considerations of a new framework and we present preliminary conclusions on this work. In particular we identify areas where the framework can be simplified in order to aid the implementation of a concurrent event processing scheme. Finally, we discuss the practical difficulties involved in migrating a large established code base to a multi-threaded framework and how this can be achieved for LHC Run 3.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.

TI Inferring User Situations from Interaction Events in Social Media

   applications
AB With the advances of Internet technologies and an explosive growth in the popularity of social media, an increasingly large part of human life is getting digitized and becoming available on the web. This phenomenon brings opportunities and motivates us to infer users' situations by exploiting their interaction events in various social media such as online social networks, blogs and email. One of the key requirements of inferring situations from interaction events is to consider both the semantic and temporal aspects of events in the situation inference process. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a novel approach to exploiting users' interaction events in social media to infer their situations. We present an ontology-based interaction event model that captures the properties of users' interaction activities in social media. We further provide a rule-based situation specification technique that integrates the interaction event ontology (for semantically matching interaction events) with temporal event relationships (for correlating historical interaction events). We also provide a platform to realize the situation reasoning/inference process, which combines semantic matching and complex event processing. We conduct a performance evaluation of the platform to quantify its efficacy. The feasibility and applicability of our approach is demonstrated by developing a socially aware phone call application as a case study.

AB In Complex Event Processing (CEP), we deal with how to search through a sequence of incoming events to find a specified and desired pattern. CEP has a broad use in today enterprise. It can act on sent and/or received events. The result can generate other events that can be used in different layers of an enterprise system. Growing number of areas dealing with arisen events like Business Activity Monitoring (BAM), Fraud detection and intrusion detection makes CEP a hot topic for researchers. Generating efficient high-performance patterns is the issue which has been addressed in this paper. The pattern can be made from any query given by user. The user defined query is CQL (Continuous Query Language) which is relevant for time series data. NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) is used for modeling patterns although it has some defects which are addressed The focus of this paper is on developing a rule modeling engine and taking into account the role of historical data to make efficient patterns. We developed some algorithms for each component of proposed model. The results are optimized patterns produced based on historical data and queries given by user. Finally we show that these techniques can be efficient when we deal with high volume event-base data.

AB In IoT applications, prediction models have fundamental challenges such as real-time processing, producing results with considerable/without delay, and taking action against pattern drift. While existing models can excel when data statistics remain relatively stable, real-time systems may encounter difficulties, particularly when confronted with dynamic shifts in data behavior. Analyzing data streams generated by different IoT applications and detecting complex pattern on the fly has become an open area of research. Complex event processing with adaptivity is a must to get desired features in such models. To address this issue, a comprehensive model for prediction has been proposed in this paper. It consists of two phases: (1) the basic model is constructed using historical data, (2) a fast Fourier transform-based adaptive support vector regression (FFT-ASVR) approach is proposed to predict events embedded in IoT data streams. FFT-ASVR predicts abnormal events by experiencing a change in data streams with real-time model updation. The performance of FFT-ASVR with a similar existing method SVM-RBF is presented using real-time traffic data of Madrid city. The proposed approach has significant improvement in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction, is adaptive in nature, and is also capable of handling the issue of pattern drift.

AB Insider threats are evolving constantly and misuse the granted resource access for various malicious activities. These insider threats make use of internal network flaws as the loop holes and are the root cause for data exfiltration and infiltration (Data leakage). Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern. The performance of the proposed Hybrid IDS is examined using test bed with normal and various attack scenarios.

AB Software has spent the bounty of Moore's law by solving harder problems and exploiting abstractions, such as high-level languages, virtual machine technology, binary rewriting, and dynamic analysis. Abstractions make programmers more productive and programs more portable, but usually slow them down. Since Moore's law is now delivering multiple cores instead of faster processors. future systems must either bear a relatively higher cost for abstractions or use some cores to help tolerate abstraction costs.
   This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel concurrent, configurable dynamic analysis framework that efficiently utilizes multicore cache architectures It introduces Cache-friendly Asymmetric Buffering (CAB), a lock-free ring-buffer that implements efficient communication between application and analysis threads We guide the design and implementation of our framework with a model of dynamic analysis overheads. The framework implements exhaustive and sampling event processing and is analysis-neutral. We evaluate the framework with five popular and diverse analyses, and show performance improvements even for lightweight, low-overhead analyses.
   Efficient inter-core communication is central to high performance parallel systems and we believe the CAB design gives insight into the subtleties and difficulties of attaining it for dynamic analysis and other parallel software.

AB Output production and predicate detection are critical in speculative parallel discrete event simulation, since they need to take place accessing past state values-which have become committed-rather than the current state of the simulation objects, which is possibly affected by causality errors related to speculative event processing. In this article, we present an architecture that enables an effective management of the access to the committed state of any simulation object while still guaranteeing: (i) minimal impact on the forward execution of the simulation in terms of synchronization (and roll-back generation) and (ii) highly balanced distribution of the tasks among all the threads running the simulation application. Our architecture is devised for speculative simulation engines running on top of shared-memory parallel machines, where worker threads full share the simulation workload. We exploit kernel-level facilities-targeting the Linux operating system-and user level ones, which work together for enabling a suited wall-clock-time collocation of the threads' activities for the access to the committed global state of the simulation. We integrated our proposal within the USE (Ultimate Share-Everything) open-source simulation platform, and provide an experimental assessment of it.

AB The QuickSilver Event Processing Module (EPM) is a key component of a high performance data acquisition platform from Siemens Molecular Imaging (Knoxville, TN) for use in the Inveon (TM) line of multimodal PET and SPECT preclinical imaging systems. The card's main purpose is to condition, digitize and process incoming analog pubes from PMT or APD based PET or SPECT detectors. Analog pulses from a detector are digitized using a 100MHz continuous sampling ADC and read into a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA for processing. The FPGA performs digital integration, baseline offset correction and pileup rejection. Because these functions are done in the digital domain, different algorithms can be quickly re-implemented and tested The EPM has the ability to capture raw event ADC samples, allowing for the quick development and comparison of new algorithms in software on actual event samples. The Inveon (TM) small animal PET scanner uses a larger LSO block detector and new analog front end than previous generation scanners which increases the likelihood of pileup events. The digital pulse processing methods presented here have been evaluated to obtain the best energy and positioning performance from the high pixel count Inveon (TM) detectors while maintaining high stability across countrates.

AB Sensing technologies provide system applications with the awareness of environmental conditions, customer behaviours, object movements, etc. Further, with such capability, system applications can be smart to intelligently adapt their responses to the changing conditions. With regard to business operations, these system applications ensure that business processes can run more intelligently and adaptively. These features will undoubtedly improve customer experience, enhance the reliability of service delivery and lower the operational cost for a more competitive and sustainable business. To enable context awareness to business process management, this paper proposes a conceptual method of depicting the context of a business process and the related mechanism of perceiving the contextual dynamics. A running example demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method and the improvements to process performance are evaluated using process simulations.

AB Traffic congestion in large cities became a huge problem, which can lead to a lot of losses especially at the human and material levels. This paper proposes a decentralized model based on multi-agent systems (MAS) and complex event processing (CEP). The new control scheme aims to improve green light time in order to reduce the average waiting time of vehicles in front of the traffic light, especially if the road is empty, and to reduce congestion at crossroad. This improvement is provided by the observation of the intersection through Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). This paper propose an auto-adaptive model for smart regulation traffic lights. The developed model will be evaluated and analyzed using different metrics and scenarios so as to test their influence on system performance.

AB This work intends to predict traffic congestions from high-speed IoT data streams using Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines. As CEP engines are reactive in nature and have static thresholds, we propose an unsupervised Genetic Algorithm based clustering procedure which classifies the traffic into congestion and no-congestion classes. It also enables the CEP rule engine to form complex events with adaptive thresholds which change with context. Extensive analysis of traffic features is implemented so as to identify the relationship between temporal, environmental and social features and their impact on the CEP rule formation. A high recall of 96.8% indicates better performance, with lesser false positives, over baseline, and multiple hypothesis test results further, strengthen the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Background: There is evidence that individuals with high levels of social anxiety utilize more safety behaviours and experience more post-event processing than those with lower levels of social anxiety. There are also data to suggest that the relationship between safety behaviour use and social anxiety symptoms is mediated by perceived control of one's anxiety. Furthermore, it has been suggested that post-event processing influences anticipatory anxiety for a future social situation. Aim: A direct link between the perpetuating factors of social anxiety described above has not been established in the literature. The aim of the current study was to test a model examining the relationship between these constructs. Method: Participants first completed a battery of questionnaires. They then participated in an impromptu, 3-minute speech and were informed they would be videotaped. Following the speech, participants completed measures of anxiety and were instructed to return the following week. During the second session, they were informed they would deliver an additional speech and provided ratings of their anxiety in anticipation of delivering the second speech. Results: The results of a serial mediation support that greater levels of social anxiety lead to less perceived control over one's anxiety, leading to increased safety behaviour use. The increase in safety behaviours led to an increase of post-event processing which resulted in greater anticipatory anxiety for a future speech task. Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence for the importance of perceived control in the genesis of social anxiety, which has implications for treatment.

ID STANDARD
AB The IEC 61499 Function Block architecture is considered as the next generation of programmable control technology promoting distributed control in automation. In this paper, the redesign methodologies from the PLC control to the event-driven architecture of IEC 61499 function blocks are proposed. A general set of translation steps and mapping rules for redesigning applications from IEC 61131-3 PLC to IEC 61499 Function Blocks is provided. Three different redesign approaches are proposed: object-oriented conversion approach, object-oriented reuse approach, and class-oriented approach. These approaches are to be applied for different design styles of the source PLC code. The data handling efficiency of all approaches is investigated. An airport baggage handling system is chosen as the case study for the redesign process. The rules and limitations are summarized and guidelines for the redesign process are provided.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the issue of insufficient PLC performance in an airport baggage handling system. When trying to deploy distributed control to PLC based baggage handling systems and provide intelligence to each PLC for sorting bags and malfunction detection, the efficiency and performance problems occur. Also, the PLC is not capable of reconfiguring the program during the operation. The performance of data update on a fieldbus deteriorates when more PLCs are connected to it.
   This paper suggests to use IEC 61499 standard and distributed control to solve those problems and proposes a way to migrate to IEC 61499 from IEC 61131-3 PLCs. By applying the proposed object-oriented and class-oriented design patterns for combining IEC 61499 with IEC 61131-3, the migration of centrally controlled baggage handling systems to distributed control systems is feasible. In this paper, we present a general translation methodology for both object-oriented and class-oriented approaches. Also, the data handling efficiency over the distributed control system network is investigated and suggestions are made for minimize the processing time for data handling. The real airport baggage handling system example is used for illustration of our migration method. The limitations of both approaches are provided and recommendations for how to apply each approach are also given. In the future work, we will focus on the negotiation between distributed notes and runtime reconfiguration for distributed notes by applying the IEC 61499 standard.

AB Several current and proposed experiments at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA, have novel data acquisition needs. These include 1) continuous digitization, using commercial high-speed digitizers, of signals from the detectors, 2) the transfer of all of the digitized waveform data to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processors, 3) the filtering or compression of the waveform data, or both, and 4) the writing of the resultant data to disk for later, more complete, analysis.
   To address these needs, members of the Accelerator and Detector Simulation and Support Department within the Scientific Computing Division at Fermilab are using parallel processing technologies in the development of artdaq, a generic data acquisition toolkit. The artdaq toolkit uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) and art, an established event-processing framework shared by new experiments at Fermilab. In an artdaq program, the digitized data are transferred into computing nodes using commodity Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cards, and event fragments are transferred between distributed processes using MPI and assembled into complete events. These events are then processed by a configurable selection of user-specified algorithms, commonly including filtering and compression algorithms, using the art event-processing framework.
   This paper describes the architecture and implementation of the first phase of the artdaq toolkit and shows early performance results with configurations that match upcoming experiments both at Fermilab and elsewhere.

AB Streaming data processing has been gaining attention due to its application into a wide range of scenarios. To serve the booming demands of streaming data processing, many computation engines have been developed. However, there is still a lack of real-world benchmarks that would be helpful when choosing the most appropriate platform for serving real-time streaming needs. In order to address this problem, we developed a streaming benchmark for three representative computation engines: Flink, Storm and Spark Streaming. Instead of testing speed-of-light event processing, we construct a full data pipeline using Kafka and Redis in order to more closely mimic the real-world production scenarios. Based on our experiments, we provide a performance comparison of the three data engines in terms of 99th percentile latency and throughput for various configurations.

AB The smart home based on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other technologies provides people a living environment with security, convenience, comfort, environmental protection and intelligence. One of the key issues for the smart home service system is how to process real-time data from IoT layer rapidly and supply an initiative service with precision, individuation and intelligence. This paper proposes a smart home service framework based on event matching, and designs a hierarchical model for smart home services supporting real-time data awareness, data processing, event processing and service mapping. At the same time we improve the Rete algorithm to implement event engine and analyze the performance of the improved Rete algorithm. At last, an application is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the smart home service based on event matching.

AB Humans segment the continuous stream of sensory information into distinct events at points of change. Between 2 events, humans perceive an event boundary. Present theories propose changes in the sensory information to trigger updating processes of the present event model. Increased encoding effort finally leads to a memory benefit at event boundaries. Evidence from reading time studies (increased reading times with increasing amount of change) suggest that updating of event models is incremental. We present results from 5 experiments that studied event processing (including memory formation processes and reading times) using an audio drama as well as a transcript thereof as stimulus material. Experiments 1a and 1b replicated the event boundary advantage effect for memory. In contrast to recent evidence from studies using visual stimulus material, Experiments 2a and 2b found no support for incremental updating with normally sighted and blind participants for recognition memory. In Experiment 3, we replicated Experiment 2a using a written transcript of the audio drama as stimulus material, allowing us to disentangle encoding and retrieval processes. Our results indicate incremental updating processes at encoding (as measured with reading times). At the same time, we again found recognition performance to be unaffected by the amount of change. We discuss these findings in light of current event cognition theories.

AB We proposed an algorithm for fall detection based on event pattern matching with ultrasonic array sensors signal. In several references cited later using ultrasonic sensors to detect human fall. But shows miss detection of event pattern matching algorithm. Our contributions are the algorithm and improvement of the human fall detection results. We predict that the major bottleneck would be the implementation of ultrasonic array sensors. The type of falling events was determined through the implemented SVM model. The CEP and Event Pattern Matching are then applied to verify the falling event to ensure no false positive result taken place. The results demonstrate that a better performance can be achieved based on the designed algorithm. The quality of images also plays an important role of accuracy.

AB The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest research organization for particle physics. ALICE, short for A Large Ion Collider Experiment, serves as one of the main detectors at CERN and produces approximately 15 petabytes of data each year. The computing associated with an ALICE experiment consists of both online and offline processing. An online cluster retrieves data while an offline cluster farm performs a broad range of data analysis. Online processing occurs as collision events are streamed from the detector to the online cluster. This process compresses and calibrates the data before storing it in a data storage system for subsequent offline processing, e.g., event reconstruction. Due to the large volume of stored data to process, offline processing seeks to minimize execution time and data staging time of the applications via a two-tier offline cluster the Event Processing Node (EPN) as the first tier and the World LHC Grid Computing (WLGC) as the second tier. This two-tier cluster requires a smart job scheduler to efficiently manage the running of the application. Thus, we propose a runtime estimation method for this offline processing in the ALICE environment.
   Our approach exploits application profiles to predict the runtime of a high-performance computing (HPC) application without the need for any additional metadata. To evaluate our proposed framework, we performed our experiment on the actual ALICE applications. In addition, we also test the efficacy of our runtime estimation method to predict the run times of the HPC applications on the Amazon EC2 cloud. The results show that our approach generally delivers accurate predictions, i.e., low error percentages. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale oil refineries are equipped with mission-critical heavy machinery (boilers, engines, turbines, and so on) and are continuously monitored by thousands of sensors for process efficiency, environmental safety, and predictive maintenance purposes. However, sensors themselves are also prone to errors and failure. The quality of data received from these sensors should be verified before being used in system modeling. There is a need for reliable methods and systems that can provide data validation and reconciliation in real-time with high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel method for real-time data validation, gross error detection and classification over multivariate sensor data streams. The validated and high-quality data obtained from these processes is used for pattern analysis and modeling of industrial plants. We obtain sensor data from the power and petrochemical plants of an oil refinery and analyze them using various time-series modeling and data mining techniques that we integrate into a complex event processing engine. Next, we study the computational performance implications of the proposed methods and uncover regimes where they are sustainable over fast streams of sensor data. Finally, we detect shifts among steady-states of data, which represent systems' multiple operating modes and identify the time when a model reconstruction is required using DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

AB This paper examines whether cross-linguistic differences in motion encoding affect event processing, specifically memory performance. We compared speakers of two languages which differ strikingly in how they habitually encode MANNER and PATH of motion (Talmy in Toward a cognitive semantics: typology and process in concept structuring, 2nd edn, vol 2. MIT Press, Cambridge, 2000). We tested French and English adult native speakers across three tasks that recruited and/or suppressed verbal processing to different extents: verbal event descriptions elicited on the basis of dynamic motion stimuli, a verbal memory task testing the impact of prior verbalisation on target recognition, and a non-verbal memory task, using a dual-task paradigm to suppress internal verbalisation. Results showed significant group differences in the verbal description task, which mirrored expected typological tendencies. English speakers more frequently expressed both MANNER and PATH information than French speakers, who produced more descriptions encoding either PATH or MANNER alone. However, these differences in linguistic encoding did not significantly affect speakers' memory performance in the memory recognition tasks, neither in the verbal nor in the non-verbal condition. The findings contribute to current debates regarding the conditions under which language effects occur and the relative weight of language-specific and universal constraints on spatial cognition.

DE differential privacy; IoT; CEP; data streams
AB Complex event processing (CEP) is a powerful and increasingly more important tool to analyse data streams for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These data streams often contain private information that requires proper protection. However, privacy protection in CEP systems is still in its infancy, and most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPMs) are adopted from those designed for data streams. Such approaches undermine the quality of the entire data stream and limit the performance of IoT applications. In this paper, we attempt to break the limitation and establish a new foundation for PPMs of CEP by proposing a novel pattern-level differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We introduce two PPMs that guarantee pattern-level DP. They operate only on data that correlate with private patterns rather than on the entire data stream, leading to higher data quality. One of the PPMs provides adaptive privacy protection and brings more granularity and generalization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed PPMs with two experiments on a real-world dataset and on a synthetic dataset. The results of the experiments indicate that our proposed privacy guarantee and its PPMs can deliver better data quality under equally strong privacy guarantees, compared to multiple well-known PPMs designed for data streams.

AB Data acquisition systems for high energy physics experiments read-out terabytes of data per second from a large number of electronic components. They are thus inherently distributed systems and require fast online data selection, otherwise requirements for permanent storage would be enormous. Still, incoming data need to be buffered while waiting for this selection to happen. Each minute of an experiment can produce hundreds of terabytes that cannot be lost before a selection decision is made. In this context, we present the design of DAQDB (Data Acquisition Database) a distributed key-value store for high-bandwidth, generic data storage in event-driven systems. DAQDB offers not only high-capacity and low-latency buffer for fast data selection, but also opens a new approach in high-bandwidth data acquisition by decoupling the lifetime of the data analysis processes from the changing event rate due to the duty cycle of the data source. This is achievable by the option to extend its capacity even up to hundreds of petabytes to store hours of an experiment's data. Our initial performance evaluation shows that DAQDB is a promising alternative to generic database solutions for the high luminosity upgrades of the LHC at CERN.

AB The set of events available for execution in a Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) are known as the pending event set. In a Time Warp synchronized simulation engine, these pending events are scheduled for execution in an aggressive manner that does not strictly enforce the causal relations between events. One of the key principles of Time Warp is that this relaxed causality will result in the processing of events in a manner that implicitly satisfies their causal order without paying the overhead costs of a strict enforcement of their causal order. On a shared memory platform the event scheduler generally attempts to schedule all available events in their Least TimeStamp First (LTSF) order to facilitate event processing in their causal order. By following an LTSF scheduling policy, a Time Warp scheduler can generally process events so that: (i) the critical path of the event timestamps is scheduled as early as possible, and (ii) causal violations occur infrequently. While this works effectively to minimize rollback (triggered by causal violations), as the number of parallel threads increases, the contention to the shared data structures holding the pending events can have significant negative impacts on overall event processing throughput.
   This work examines the application of profile data taken from Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) models to drive the simulation kernel optimization process. In particular, we take profile data about events in the schedule pool from three DES models to derive alternate scheduling possibilities in a Time Warp simulation kernel. Profile data from the studied DES models suggests that in many cases each Logical Process (LP) in a simulation will have multiple events that can be dequeued and executed as a set. In this work, we review the profile data and implement group event scheduling strategies based on this profile data. Experimental results show that event group scheduling can help alleviate contention and improve performance. However, the size of the event groups matters, small groupings can improve performance, larger groupings can trigger more frequent causal violations and actually slow the parallel simulation.

AB Sequence data is prevalent, and event processing over sequences is increasingly important in this big data era, drawing much attention from both research and industry. In this paper, we address a novel problem, which is to find common event subsequences from two long sequences. This problem is well motivated, with applications in diverse domains. We propose the window-chained longest common subsequence (WCLCS) semantics, and argue that the traditional longest common subsequence (LCS) cannot serve this need. We then devise efficient algorithms to solve this problem by reducing it to a graph problem. We also propose two more methods to improve the performance: one is based on informed search and exploration, and the other is an approximation algorithm with accuracy guarantees. We finally carry out a systematic experimental evaluation using two real-world datasets and some synthetic datasets.

AB At the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, atomic nuclei are collided at ultra-relativistic energies. Many final-state particles are produced in each collision and their properties are measured by the ALICE detector. The detector signals induced by the produced particles are digitized leading to data rates that are in excess of 48 GB/s. The ALICE High Level Trigger (HLT) system pioneered the use of FPGA- and GPU-based algorithms to reconstruct charged-particle trajectories and reduce the data size in real time. The results of the reconstruction of the collision events, available online, are used for high level data quality and detector-performance monitoring and real-time time-dependent detector calibration. The online data compression techniques developed and used in the ALICE HLT have more than quadrupled the amount of data that can be stored for offline event processing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Proper Health-Care Waste Management (HCWM) and integrated documentation in this sector of hospitals require analyzing massive data collected by hospital's health experts. This study presented a quantitative software-based index to assess the HCWM process performance by integrating ontology-based Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making techniques and fuzzy modeling that were coupled with data mining. This framework represented the Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) types of Process Mining in which a user-friendly software namely Group Fuzzy Decision-Making (GFDM) was employed for index calculation.
   Findings: Assessing the governmental hospitals of Shiraz, Iran in 2016 showed that the proposed index was able to determine the waste management condition and clarify the blind spots of HCWM in the hospitals. The index values under 50 were found in some of the hospitals showing poor process performance that should be at the priority of optimization and improvement.
   Conclusion: The proposed framework has distinctive features such as modeling the uncertainties (risks) in hospitals' process assessment and flexibility enabling users to define the intended criteria, stakeholders, and number of hospitals. Having computer-aided approach for decision process also accelerates the index calculation as well as its accuracy which would contribute to more willingness of hospitals' experts and other end-users to use the index in practice. The methodology could efficiently be employed as a tool for managing hospitals' event logs and digital documentation in big data environment not only for the health-care waste management, but also in other administrative wards of hospitals.

AB Continuous crystal-based positron emission tomography (PET) detectors could be an ideal alternative for current high-resolution pixelated PET detectors if the issues of high performance gamma interaction position estimation and its real-time implementation are solved. Unfortunately, existing position estimators are not very feasible for implementation on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In this paper, we propose a new self-organizing map neural network-based nearest neighbor (SOM-NN) positioning scheme aiming not only at providing high performance, but also at being realistic for FPGA implementation. Benefitting from the SOM feature mapping mechanism, the large set of input reference events at each calibration position is approximated by a small set of prototypes, and the computation of the nearest neighbor searching for unknown events is largely reduced. Using our experimental data, the scheme was evaluated, optimized and compared with the smoothed k-NN method. The spatial resolutions of full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of both methods averaged over the center axis of the detector were obtained as 1.87 +/- 0.17 mm and 1.92 +/- 0.09 mm, respectively. The test results show that the SOM-NN scheme has an equivalent positioning performance with the smoothed k-NN method, but the amount of computation is only about one-tenth of the smoothed k-NN method. In addition, the algorithm structure of the SOM-NN scheme is more feasible for implementation on FPGA. It has the potential to realize real-time position estimation on an FPGA with a high-event processing throughput.

AB Although social anxiety symptoms are robustly linked to biased self-evaluations across time, the mechanisms of this relation remain unclear. The present study tested three maladaptive emotion regulation strategies - state post-event processing, state experiential avoidance, and state expressive suppression - as potential mediators of this relation. Undergraduate participants (N = 88; 61.4% Female) rated their social skill in an impromptu conversation task and then returned to the laboratory approximately two days later to evaluate their social skill in the conversation again. Consistent with expectations, state post-event processing and state experiential avoidance mediated the relation between social anxiety symptoms and worsening self-evaluations of social skill (controlling for research assistant evaluations), particularly for positive qualities (e.g. appeared confident, demonstrated social skill). State expressive suppression did not mediate the relation between social anxiety symptoms and changes in self-evaluation bias across time. These findings highlight the role that spontaneous, state experiential avoidance and state post-event processing may play in the relation between social anxiety symptoms and worsening self-evaluation biases of social skill across time.

AB Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) often show particular problems in seemingly simple routines despite relatively preserved cognitive function. We therefore investigated the processing of everyday events on behavioral and neurophysiological levels in a PD and control group. The participants had to indicate via button press whether three sequentially presented sub-events described a previously defined event (e.g., going grocery shopping). Sub-event sequences were either correct or included an event that did not belong to the event (content violation), or events were chronologically wrong (temporal violation). During task execution event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Generally, the PD group showed less accurate performance independently from task conditions, and reaction times to temporal violations were particularly slow compared to the control group. Regarding ERP results, the control group showed a right lateralized N400 effect in response to content violations, which was absent in the PD group indicating altered content event processing. Concerning the reanalysis of content event violations, the expression of late positive components (LPCs) was similar between both groups. Upon temporal violations, both groups also showed a LPC with a tendentially earlier onset in the PD group, resembling positive components indicative of novelty processing. Together, these findings suggest poor event prediction in PD, which may originate from weak event representation or retrieval and possibly relate to prevalent behavioral dysfunctions in everyday life in PD.

AB The enormous growth of multimedia content in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to the challenge of processing multimedia streams in real-time. Event-based systems are constructed to process event streams. They cannot natively consume multimedia event types produced by the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) generated data to answer multimedia-based user subscriptions. Machine learning-based techniques have enabled rapid progress in solving real-world problems and need to be optimised for the low response time of the multimedia event processing paradigm. In this paper, we describe a classifier construction approach for the training of online classifiers, that can handle dynamic subscriptions with low response time and provide reasonable accuracy for the multimedia event processing. We find that the current object detection methods can be configured dynamically for the construction of classifiers in real-time, by tuning hyperparameters even when training from scratch. Our experiments demonstrate that deep neural network-based object detection models, with hyperparameter tuning, can improve the performance within less training time for the answering of previously unknown user subscriptions. The results from this study show that the proposed online classifier training based model can achieve accuracy of 79.00% with 15-min of training and 84.28% with 1-hour training from scratch on a single GPU for the processing of multimedia events.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) represent a network of resource-constrained sensor devices connected through the open Internet, susceptible to misuse by intruders. Traditional standalone intrusion detection systems (IDS) are tasked with monitoring device behaviours to identify malicious activities. These systems not only require extensive network and system resources but also cause delays in detecting a malicious actor due to unavailability of a comprehensive view of the intruder's activities. Collaboration among IoT devices enables considering knowledge from a collection of host and network devices to achieve improved detection accuracy in a timely manner. However, collaboration introduces the challenge of energy efficiency and event processing which is particularly significant for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a collaborative intrusion detection framework (COLIDE) for IoT leveraging collaboration among resource-constrained sensor and border nodes for effective and timely detection of intruders. The paper presents a detailed formal description of the proposed framework along with analysis to assess its effectiveness for a typical IoT system. We implemented the COLIDE framework with Contiki OS and conducted thorough experimentation to evaluate its performance. The evaluation demonstrates efficiency of COLIDE framework with respect to energy and processing overheads achieving effectiveness within an IoT system.

AB Mutation testing is a well-known fault-based technique that has been applied to different domains as new technologies have appeared. Evolutionary Mutation Testing (EMT) finds mutants that are useful to produce new test cases. It uses evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of mutants that are generated, keeping as many difficult to kill and stubborn mutants (strong mutants) as possible in the reduced set. Given the popularity of real-time systems, the MuEPL mutation system was developed for the Esper Event Processing Language (EPL), a query language aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT). In past work, EMT was integrated into MuEPL, and it reduced the cost of finding strong mutants in some EPL queries but not in others. This study takes a step forward by proposing and evaluating two metaheuristics for EMT that combine EMT and random selection: one which bootstraps the hall of fame with a random subset (Bootstrapped EMT), and one which falls back to random selection after a certain point (Inverse EMT). While BEMT is shown to outperform IEMT in most cases, BEMT has not managed to outperform EMT. An additional experiment studies the impact of low-quality mutation operators in the relative performance of BEMT, IEMT and plain EMT. Results suggest that the MuEPL RRO operator was the reason for the poor performance of EMT in some scenarios.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical, cyber and human spaces. Event-based system is one of the cornerstones to help IoT achieve real-time monitoring, context-awareness and intelligent control. In the era of big data, the huge amount and high complexity of event inference rule pose a great challenge to traditional event-based system in its efficiency, especially resources-constrained IoT edge systems. This paper proposes a high-efficiency joint event inference model for real-time context-awareness and decision-making in IoT edge systems. We define different kinds of redundancy relations between event inference models and propose a description mechanism, named event containing graph, to support multi-pattern optimization. Three operations on single-pattern event inference models, Merge, Failure and Output are defined respectively. The joint inference model is established by merging sharing patterns, constructing failure transitions and conditional output to eliminate inter-model redundancies. Experimental results prove that the joint model consumes less computational resources and provides higher performance than other benchmarks. It also verifies and proves that joint model has better optimization effect when processing large number of complex events. Especially in edge computing environment, joint inference model improves the real-time performance and significantly reduces the energy consumption in data transmission from edges to data center.

AB Interest about security and asset safety escalates due to the increasing crimes in this century. However, almost all existing surveillance systems have limited self-learning ability that only allow real time monitoring and are unable to identify the actual events that take place in the monitored ambient. As such, this research aims to implement a smart surveillance system with embedded Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology to assist the intrusion detection by correlating raw data extracted from different sources. Four classifiers are used in the CEP engine to predict the event occurrences from the raw data sequence pattern acquired from the door sensors and surveillance camera via intelligent rule template matching algorithm. Confusion matrix in terms of sensitivity, specificity and average detection accuracy as well as ROC plot are employed in classifier performance evaluation to quantify the efficiency of the surveillance system developed.

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHIZOPHRENIC THINKING AND MMPI FOR PROCESS AND
   REACTIVE PATIENTS
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
DT Article
AB The relationship between Whitaker Index of Schizophrenic Thinking (WIST) and MMPI [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory] performance in 25 male Process and Reactive schizophrenic inpatients was studied. A correlation exists between the WIST index and the Sc [schizophrenia] scale of the MMPI for Process patients only. Other MMPI scales highly correlated with each other also correlated with WIST index for the Process group. The lack of association between WIST and MMPI scales for Reactive patients suggested a high degree of behavioral disorganization in these patients. There was a lack of correlation between time and error scores on the WIST and a high variability of time scores on the WIST. The disorganization for the Reactive patients may be understood in terms of disrupted pacing of behavior with respoct to time, a process that may be related to the intrusion of irrelevant event processing.

AB Social media software changes its system-wide privacy policies over time. Changes in such system-wide policies affect the privacy policies of the individual users. In turn, social media users lack the ability to configure and enforce customized privacy policies according to the precise privacy measure that they demand. To this end, we argue that there is an emerging need for third-party solutions that are independent of existing social media software and that can detect custom privacy policy violations. In order to address this need, we propose an approach to detecting custom privacy violations for social media users. We also introduce a generic software architecture that can be integrated with existing social media software to enable users to keep track of their data. The proposed solution utilizes social provenance data, which is defined as the metadata that describe the lifecycle of the data. To facilitate testing of the software architecture, we developed a prototype implementation and generated a large-scale synthetic provenance dataset. We discuss the details of the prototype implementation and the synthetic dataset. We evaluate the performance of the prototype under an increasing workload. We show the usability of the proposed architecture, as the initial performance testing results are promising.

AB The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is the primary instrument on the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), a space based observatory which is scheduled to launch late this year. The LAT traces its heritage from the particle physics community and represents a large departure in design and capability from previous space based experiments. Similarly, power, communication, and physical access limitations of a space based platform place strict requirements on the design and reliability of both the LAT and its Trigger and Datallow (T&DF) system. The resulting T&DF system consists of a hierarchical trigger with both Level 0 and Level 3 components, distributed event processing, and slow control. We describe our experiences developing and testing the T&DF system in the context of a space mission, and we report the performance and status of the system as GLAST approaches launch.

AB A cloud environment always includes multiple cloud providers, which have their own resources and can access each other with specified methods. However, it is challenging to monitor an application deployed in such a environment due to their heterogeneous metadata and interfaces. In this paper, we develop a pub/sub monitoring system over a cloud environment. Several probes are designed to collect data and we apply complex event processing to reduce network traffic. We propose an adaptive method to adjust the monitoring frequency, which can save communication cost and not loss the most feature of monitoring data. Moreover, we develop a new method NBS to balance the workload of our cluster and it can improve the performance of our system. We deploy our system in three clouds and the results show that our methods can improve the throughput of the monitoring system.

AB Smartphones have become highly personalized interfaces between people and the technology ecosystem around them. In this sense, they play a key role for a technology shift from the current Internet of Things to a future human-centric paradigm of an Internet of People, automatically adapting smart things and services to the preferences and context of their users. In this paper, we propose the use of Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines deployed in the users' smartphones granting them context-awareness capabilities in order to react to external stimulus, and enabling them to interact both with smart things and services in the surroundings of the users. With that purpose, we have designed a communication architecture that interconnects CEP engines running on smartphones, providing a framework for building applications for Mobile-based Collaborative Social Computing (MCSC). For that, we make use of previous works of the authors with Digital Avatars, a framework which promotes the use of smartphones for inferring and sharing a unique digital avatar or virtual profile of each user. The resulting framework, which we have called Collaborative CEP, allows to implement complex interactions among users, and between them and the IoT, a common need in Collaborative Social Computing applications. We provide a proof of concept based on the implementation of a Cops and Robbers game to test the expressiveness and correct functioning of the framework, and we evaluate its performance and efficiency.

AB Airport management companies are facing increasing passenger numbers and the pressure to provide high-quality ground services to satisfy the passengers' needs and expectations. A new kind of information system is required, monitoring passenger figures in real time to estimate the time and location when and where a service must be provided and responsible staff scheduled. We suggest an event processing platform which is built upon an industry-proven technology and aggregates streams of information about passenger frequency occurring in heterogeneous formats and with different frequencies to a key performance indicator reflecting the current state of selected areas at the airport. Following the design research principle, we conducted a requirements analysis and developed a prototypical system which efficiently fuses the data streams and generates alerts to notify staff if passenger satisfaction threatens to drop. The system was evaluated with historical data from one of the 20 largest airports in Europe. The evaluation is based on a simulation and provides evidence that the system has the potential to improve customer satisfaction. In addition, due to the event-based architecture, a generic API allows a smooth integration of new data sources, the parametrization of the event rules aggregating and processing all data, and thus, an intuitive usage by the airport operator. The final tool consists of the event processing module and a dashboard supporting airport managers in keeping track of the important quality attribute passenger satisfaction and scheduling staff in the right spot at the right time.

ID DECISION-MAKING; TOPSIS
AB The high energy consumption projections of Cloud/Edge applications urge the development of ecologically sustainable Multimedia Event Processing (MEP) systems. In these applications, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem must be solved when selecting the best service workers alternatives for processing user queries, according to the user-specific performance criteria requirements of energy, accuracy and speed. Moreover, fuzzy logic provides a well-established method, such as the fuzzy TOPSIS, for dealing with the uncertainties arising from real-world scenarios, where ambiguities of user requirement interpretations and imprecision of measurement of the computing devices may directly impact this decision-making process. However, this fuzzy method is more complex and computationally intensive than the original (crisp) TOPSIS. Therefore, it is crucial to understand to what degree the fuzzy and crisp methods may be used interchangeably and still get the same results to avoid unnecessary complexity in sustainable MEP solutions in a real-world context. In our work, we developed a fuzzy TOPSIS ranking method for handling the uncertainties of the user criteria weights and service worker alternative ratings. Contrary to a previous study, we provide evidence that replacing the fuzzy TOPSIS method with its crisp counterpart significantly affects the ranking results when applied to a real-world scenario, with contradiction rates higher than 60% in most scenarios explored, which suggests that it is not viable to interchange these methods without consequences to the sustainability efforts of an MEP application.

AB Querying and reasoning over RDF streams are two increasingly relevant areas in the broader scope of processing structured data on the Web. While RDF Stream Processing (RSP) has focused so far on extending SPARQL for continuous query and event processing, stream reasoning has concentrated on ontology evolution and incremental materialization. In this paper we propose a different approach for querying RDF streams over ontologies, based on the combination of query rewriting and stream processing. We show that it is possible to rewrite continuous queries over streams of RDF data, while maintaining efficiency for a wide range of scenarios. We provide a detailed description of our approach, as well as an implementation, StreamQR, which is based on the kyrie rewriter, and can be coupled with a native RSP engine, namely CQELS. Finally, we show empirical evidence of the performance of StreamQR in a series of experiments based on the SRBench query set.

AB Noise modeling is a fundamental unexplored problem in many event camera applications. The noise modeling methods of conventional cameras are inadequate for capturing the intricate noise patterns unique to event cameras. To address this gap, we propose a novel event camera -driven noise modeling approach specifically designed to account for the unique characteristics of event camera data. Given the challenges in generating ground truth data, the proposed method is designed using unsupervised statistical techniques. The proposed noise model is camera -aware, i.e. it allows adaptability to the unique noise patterns of each sensor. It also facilitates asynchronous event processing as applied to downstream computer vision tasks. To validate the proposed noise modeling approach, we conducted extensive experiments in the context of denoising tasks. The results indicate that our noise model accurately represents the noise, leading to state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.

AB Two experiments investigated the extent to which the content of feedback and the style of post-event processing are associated with a bias in the retrieval of autobiographical memories by individuals high in social anxiety. In each experiment high and low socially anxious individuals responded to questions about autobiographical experiences, participated in a task involving real or imagined social encounters, and then recalled autobiographical memories. In Experiment 1 (n = 50) participants focused on positive or negative feedback following the social task, while in Experiment 2 (n = 59) participants engaged in either a ruminative or reflective response style following the social task. Experiment I showed that negative feedback led to the recall of memories with a significantly greater average anxiety rating only in the high social anxiety group. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the high social anxiety group who engaged in a ruminative response style recalled memories with the highest average anxiety rating. Implications of these findings for understanding the role of post-event processing as a maintaining factor in social anxiety are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to prevalent use of sensors and network monitoring tools, big volumes of data or "big data" today traverse the enterprise data processing pipelines in a streaming fashion. While some companies prefer to deploy their data processing infrastructures and services as private clouds, others completely outsource these services to public clouds. In either case, attempting to store the data first for subsequent analysis creates additional resource costs and unwanted delays in obtaining actionable information. As a result, enterprises increasingly employ data or event stream processing systems and further want to extend them with complex online analytic and mining capabilities.
   In this paper, we present implementation details for doing both correlation analysis and association rule mining (ARM) over streams. Specifically, we implement Pearson-Product Moment Correlation for analytics and Apriori & FPGrowth algorithms for stream mining inside a popular event stream processing engine called Esper. As a unique contribution, we conduct experiments and present performance results of these new tools with different tumbling and sliding time-windows over two different stream types: one for moving bus trajectories and another for web logs from a music site. We find that while tumbling windows may be more preferable for performance in certain applications, sliding windows can provide additional benefits with rule mining. We hope that our findings can shed light on the design of other cloud analytics systems.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has embraced a 'vertical' off-loading model, where avalanches of raw data generated by numerous edge devices are continuously pushed through the network to a remote processing location, such as a datacenter or a cloud. In this rather unbalanced architecture, edge devices are typically not expected to perform sophisticated data processing and analytics, and data fusion takes place remotely from the original source of data. As a result, the underlying network and the remote datacenter have to handle increased amounts of unstructured raw data, which, in turn, may affect the overall performance and decrease reaction times. As a potential solution to these shortcomings, this paper introduces a distributed hierarchical data fusion architecture for the IoT networks, consisting of edge devices, network and communications units, and cloud platforms. According to the proposed approach, different data sources are combined at each level of the IoT hierarchy to produce timely and accurate results by utilising computational capabilities of intermediate nodes. This way, mission-critical decisions, as demonstrated by the presented smart healthcare scenario, are taken with minimum time delay, as soon as necessary information is generated and collected. The initial evaluation suggests that the proposed approach enables fine-grained decision taking at different data fusion levels, and, as a result, improves the overall performance and reaction time.

AB The resolution of the PET scanners is limited by the parallax error due to the missing knowledge about Depth of Interaction (DoI) of the incident photons inside the scintillation crystal. In real time, a DoI calculator must fulfill a suitable event processing rate, which requires low complexity DoI algorithms. The DoI is obtained when the crystal within a phoswich detector is identified based on the shape of the scintillation light distribution. The main idea of this paper is to enhance the performance of crystal identification by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) feature extractor. Besides, the paper introduces a complexity reduction method by merging the SVM classification phase and DFT in order to comply with the real-time rate. A real-time FPGA-based merged DFT-SVM DoI method has been implemented and validated to discriminate pulse-shapes of LSO-LuYAP scintillation crystals events. A correct assignment of 92.2% at rate of 6.2 Mevents/s is achieved for a sample of similar to 100 000 pulses from LSO-LuYAP crystals read out using vacuum photomultipliers. Compared with recent DoI methods, the proposed method provides the highest performance and fulfills the required real-time rate of PET scanners (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Machine-learning algorithms continue to show promise in their application to seismic processing. The U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) is exploring the adoption of these tools to aid in simultaneous local, regional, and global real-time earthquake monitoring. As a first step, we describe a simple framework to incorporate deep-learning tools into NEIC operations. Automatic seismic arrival detections made from standard picking methods (e.g., short-term average/long-term average [STA/LTA]) are fed to trained neural network models to improve automatic seismic arrival (pick) timing and estimate seismic-arrival phase type and source-station distances. These additional data are used to improve the capabilities of the NEIC associator. We compile a dataset of 1.3 million seismic-phase arrivals that represent a globally distributed set of source-station paths covering a range of phase types, magnitudes, and source distances. We train three separate convolutional neural network models to predict arrival time onset, phase type, and distance. We validate the performance of the trained networks on a subset of our existing dataset and further extend validation by exploring the model performance when applied to NEIC automatic pick data feeds. We show that the information provided by these models can be useful in downstream event processing, specifically in seismic-phase association, resulting in reduced false associations and improved location estimates.

AB The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is planned to be operated in a continuous data-taking mode in Run 3. This will allow to inspect data from all Pb-Pb collisions at a rate of 50 kHz, giving access to rare physics signals embedded in a large background.
   Based on experience with real-time reconstruction of particle trajectories and event properties in the ALICE High Level Trigger, the ALICE O-2 facility is currently designed and developed to support processing of a continuous, triggerless stream of data segmented into entities referred to as timeframes.
   Both raw data input into the ALICE O-2 system and the actual processing of aggregated timeframes are distributed among multiple processes on a many node cluster. Process communication is based on the asynchronous message passing paradigm.
   This paper presents the basic concept for identification of data in the distributed system together with prototype implementations and performance measurements.

AB There is a rising interest to use sensors of various kinds for human activity recognition. Complex human activities are composed of temporally related simple activities and the concept of complex events is well suited to capture this relationship and to detect complex activities, i.e., complex events. This paper addresses the need for high accuracy of complex activity detection and low battery consumption of the sensors. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a framework to obtain the required accuracy of complex activity detection and minimize the cost of delivering samples from the sensors to the sink. We formalize the problem as an integer-programming problem and solve it by an approximation approach. The goal is to satisfy the user specified accuracy at a minimum cost. We compare the performance of our approximation approach with exact method for complex human activity determination. Evaluation results with a publicly available dataset demonstrate the potential impact of our approach.

AB For a long time, one of the major research goals in the computer science research community has been to raise the level of abstraction power of specification languages/programming languages. Many specification languages and formalisms have been invented, but unfortunately very few of those are practically useful, due to limited computer support of these languages and/or inefficient implementations. Thus, one important goal is executable specification languages of high abstraction power and with high performance, good enough for practical usage and comparable in execution speed to hand implementations of applications in low-level languages such as C or C++. In this paper we briefly describe our work in creating efficient executable specification languages for two application domains. The first area is formal specification of programming language semantics, whereas the second is formal specification of complex systems for which we have developed an object-oriented mathematical modeling language called Modelica, including architectural support for components and connectors. Based on these efforts, we are currently working on a unified equation-based mathematical modeling language that can handle modeling of items as diverse as programming languages, computer algebra, event-driven systems, and continuous-time physical systems. The key unifying feature is the notion of equation. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the unified language. A compiler implementation is already up and running, and used for substantial applications.

AB Background: Although cognitive-behavioural therapy is the gold standard psychological treatment for individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD), it does not benefit everyone. Emotional working memory training (eWMT) is a promising alternative intervention. This study examined the effects of eWMT versus control training (CT) on emotional and cognitive outcomes in individuals with elevated social anxiety.
   Methods: Forty participants with elevated social anxiety were randomly allocated to eWMT (n= 21) or CT (n= 19), each consisting of six training sessions. At pre- and post-training, participants completed: a working memory task, an impromptu speech, and self-reported measures of emotional and cognitive outcomes (anticipatory processing, peak anxiety and attentional focus during the speech, post-event processing).
   Results: Participants in both training conditions exhibited performance improvements on their respective training tasks. As expected, there was a Time x Condition interaction for peak anxiety, reflecting a decrease in peak anxiety for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition. Exploratory analyses also indicated a Time x Condition interaction for an aspect of post-event processing, reflecting a decrease in thinking about the past for the eWMT condition but not the CT condition.
   Limitations: Although the level of social anxiety of the current sample is comparable to that of samples of individuals diagnosed with SAD in the literature, participant diagnoses were not assessed in this study.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that eWMT has potential as an alternative intervention for individuals with elevated social anxiety.

AB The new event cameras are now widely used in many computer vision applications. Their high raw data bitrate levels require a more efficient fixed-length representation for low-bandwidth transmission from the event sensor to the processing chip. A novel low-complexity lossless compression framework is proposed for encoding the synchronous event frames (EFs) by introducing a novel memory-efficient fixed-length representation suitable for hardware implementation in the very-low-power (VLP) event-processing chip. A first contribution proposes an improved representation of the ternary frames using pixel-group frame partitioning and symbol remapping. Another contribution proposes a novel low-complexity memory-efficient fixed-length representation using multi-level lookup tables (LUTs). Complex experimental analysis is performed using a set of group-size configurations. For very-large group-size configurations, an improved representation is proposed using a mask-LUT structure. The experimental evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed fixed-length coding framework provides at least two times the compression ratio relative to the raw EF representation and a close performance compared with variable-length video coding standards and variable-length state-of-the-art image codecs for lossless compression of ternary EFs generated at frequencies bellow one KHz. To our knowledge, the paper is the first to introduce a low-complexity memory-efficient fixed-length representation for lossless compression of synchronous EFs, suitable for integration into a VLP event-processing chip.

   computing; Cloud computing; edge computing; fog computing; Internet of
   Things; middleware; smart city
AB In this article, we present and analyze MUSANet, a hierarchical, distributed, context-aware architecture for collecting, processing, and distributing data in smart cities. We discuss some use case examples related to monitoring and predicting bus arrivals in public transportation and weather conditions. We also present performance results in different scenarios that point to the feasibility of our goal: a scalable architecture with a fast response time to traffic events. MUSANet is based on a three-tier architecture distributed over the cloud, fog, and edge, and supporting complex event processing (CEP) in all of them. Although the system is under development using the InterSCity platform in the cloud, the ContextNet middleware at the fog, and the Mobile-Hub platform at the edge, the MUSANet architecture can be deployed using other platforms, maintaining the concept of tiering responsibilities to minimize network bandwidth and delay, group communication, and broad mobile support.

TI Event Driven Network Topology Discovery and Inventory Listing Using

SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
DT Article
DE Network topology; Inventory systems; Network monitoring; Network graph;
   Service detection; Event processing; Event normalization
AB Network Topology Discovery and Inventory Listing are two of the primary features of modern network monitoring systems (NMS). Current NMSs rely heavily on active scanning techniques for discovering and mapping network information. Although this approach works, it introduces some major drawbacks such as the performance impact it can exact, specially in larger network environments. As a consequence, scans are often run less frequently which can result in stale information being presented and used by the network monitoring system. Alternatively, some NMSs rely on their agents being deployed on the hosts they monitor. In this article, we present a new approach to Network Topology Discovery and Network Inventory Listing using only passive monitoring and scanning techniques. The proposed techniques rely solely on the event logs produced by the hosts and network devices present within a network. Finally, we discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of our approach.

AB Business Intelligence (BI) provides historical, current and predictive views of business operations with the help of some technologies, that include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. As analytics plays a major role in BI, OLAP is an integrated part of BI in modern day business application. Data warehouse is the most popular way to design and build OLAP. Data warehouse along with ETL and reporting tools provides an integrated environment for business processing. Business processing also demands decision making system and knowledge representation. Moreover the data sources are physically distributed in different locations. Hence modern day business environment is a complex architecture with a numbers of entities. In this paper authors present an integrated architecture to manage and design business intelligence environment by co-ordinating several associated entities to achieve business agility.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a new era of the Internet, which consists of several connected physical smart objects (i.e., sensing devices) through the Internet. IoT has different types of applications, such as smart home, wearable devices, smart connected vehicles, industries, and smart cities. Therefore, IoT based applications become the essential parts of our day-to-day life. In a cloud-based IoT environment, cloud platform is used to store the data accessed from the IoT sensors. Such an environment is greatly scalable and it supports realtime event processing which is very important in several scenarios (i.e., IoT sensors based surveillance and monitoring). Since some applications in cloud-based IoT are very critical, the information collected and sent by IoT sensors must not be leaked during the communication. To accord with this, we design a new lightweight authentication mechanism in cloud-based loT environment, called LAM-CIoT. By using LAM-CIoT, an authenticated user can access the data of IoT sensors remotely. LAM-CIoT applies efficient "one-way cryptographic hash functions" along with "bitwise XOR operations". In addition, fuzzy extractor mechanism is also employed at the user's end for local biometric verification. LAM-CIoT is methodically analyzed for its security part through the formal security using the broadly-accepted "Real-Or-Random (ROR)" model, formal security verification using the widely-used "Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)" tool as well as the informal security analysis. The performance analysis shows that LAM-CIoT offers better security, and low communication and computation overheads as compared to the closely related authentication schemes. Finally, LAM-CIoT is evaluated using the NS2 network simulator for the measurement of network performance parameters that envisions the impact of LAM-CIoT on the network performance of LAM-CIoT and other schemes.

AB We examined three cognitive processes hypothesized to contribute to biases in judgments about and memory for social events: self-focused attention, post-event rumination, and anticipatory processing. Socially anxious (N = 58) and nonanxious (N = 58) subjects participated in a social interaction and then completed measures of self-focused attention and anxiety-related physiological sensations and behavior. The next day, subjects completed measures that assessed frequency of post-event processing and recall of the interaction. The results indicated that selective attention to negative self-related information led to biases in social judgments and recollections and that post-event processing contributed to the recall of negative self-related information. No evidence was found for selective retrieval of negative self-related information prior to a second social interaction. The results reconcile inconsistent previous findings related to memory bias in social anxiety. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Everyday experience consists of rapidly unfolding sensory information that humans redescribe as discrete events. Quick and efficient redescription facilitates remembering, responding to, and learning from the ongoing sensory flux. Segmentation seems key to successful redescription: the extent to which viewers can identify boundaries between event units within continuously unfolding activities predicts both memory and action performance. However, what happens to processing when boundary content is missing? Events occurring in naturalistic situations seldom receive continuous undivided attention. As a consequence, information, including boundary content, is likely sometimes missed. In this research, we systematically explored the influence of missing information by asking participants to advance at their own pace through a series of slideshows. Some slideshows, while otherwise matched in content, contained just half of the slides present in other slideshows. Missing content sometimes occurred at boundaries. As it turned out, patterns of attention during slideshow viewing were strikingly similar across matched slideshows despite missing content, even when missing content occurred at boundaries. Moreover, to the extent that viewers compensated with increased attenem to further confirm an information optimization account of event processing: event boundaries receive heightened attention because they forecast unpredictability and thus, optimize the uptake of new informtion, missing content did not significantly undercut event recall. These findings seation. Missing boundary content sparks little change in patterns of attentional modulation, presumably because the underlying predictability parameters of the unfolding activity itself are unchanged by missing content. Optimizing information, thus, enables event processing and recall to be impressively resilient to missing content.

AB Complex event processing (CEP) is widely employed to detect occurrences of predefined combinations (patterns) of events in massive data streams. As new events are accepted, they are matched using some type of evaluation structure, commonly optimized according to the statistical properties of the data items in the input stream. However, in many real-life scenarios the data characteristics are never known in advance or are subject to frequent on-the-fly changes. To modify the evaluation structure as a reaction to such changes, adaptation mechanisms are employed. These mechanisms typically function by monitoring a set of properties and applying a new evaluation plan when significant deviation from the initial values is observed. This strategy often leads to missing important input changes or it may incur substantial computational overhead by over-adapting.
   In this paper, we present an efficient and precise method for dynamically deciding whether and how the evaluation structure should be reoptimized. This method is based on a small set of constraints to be satisfied by the monitored values, defined such that a better evaluation plan is guaranteed if any of the constraints is violated. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed mechanism is the first to provably avoid false positives on reoptimization decisions. We formally prove this claim and demonstrate how our method can be applied on known algorithms for evaluation plan generation. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets confirms the superiority of our strategy over existing methods in terms of performance and accuracy.

AB The forestry industry is one of the most hazardous industries in New Zealand, and the physical and cognitive fatigue of forestry workers has been shown to contribute to this. Physical and cognitive fatigue can be exacerbated by prolonged physical and cognitive workload. As such, we propose that the identification and mitigation of fatigue factors could reduce the risk of incident and injury in hazardous work environments. This paper introduces a semantic model for workload categorization. The model takes as input, a set of multi-modal physiological measurements, and uses parallel processing, complex event processing, and rule-based modelling to categorize a series of workloads (resting, cognitive workload, and physical workload). The model has undergone a set of evaluations, including categorization accuracy, and performance. The model has been tested under three scenarios: when a participant is resting and refraining from any physically or mentally demanding tasks; when a participant is undertaking a cognitively intensive task; and when a participant is walking, jogging, and running. The study has been conducted with participants between the ages of 22 and 39 and has shown an average accuracy of 89% for resting workload, 76% for cognitive workload, and 97% for physical workload. Finally, in this paper we discuss the application and extension of this model to predict fatigue in hazardous industries. The work described in this paper contributes to a larger research project centered on investigating technology uses in hazardous work environments.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this research is to explore the ways of integrating situational awareness into business process management for the purpose of realising hyper automated business processes. Such business processes will help improve their customer experiences, enhance the reliability of service delivery and lower the operational cost for a more competitive and sustainable business. Design/methodology/approach Ontology has been deployed to establish the context modelling method, and the event handling mechanisms are developed on the basis of event calculus. An approach on performance of the proposed approach has been evaluation by checking the cost savings from the simulation of a large number of business processes. Findings In this research, the authors have formalised the context presentation for a business process with a focus on rules and entities to support context perception; proposed a system architecture to illustrate the structure and constitution of a supporting system for intelligent and situation aware business process management; developed real-time event elicitation and interpretation mechanisms to operationalise the perception of contextual dynamics and real-time responses; and evaluated the applicability of the proposed approaches and the performance improvement to business processes. Originality/value This paper presents a framework covering process context modelling, system architecture and real-time event handling mechanisms to support situational awareness of business processes. The reported research is based on our previous work on radio frequency identification-enabled applications and context-aware business process management with substantial extension to process context modelling and process simulation.

AB The ATLAS High Level Trigger's primary function of event selection will be accomplished with a Level-2 trigger farm and an Event Filter farm, both running software components developed in the ATLAS offline reconstruction framework. While this approach provides a unified software framework for event selection, it poses strict requirements on offline components critical for the Level-2 trigger. A Level-2 decision in ATLAS must typically be accomplished within 10 ins and with multiple event processing in concurrent threads. In order to address these constraints, prototypes have been developed that incorporate elements of the ATLAS Data Flow -, High Level Trigger -, and offline framework software. To realize a homogeneous software environment for offline components in the High Level Trigger, the Level-2 Steering Controller was developed. With electron/gamma- and muonselection slices it has been shown that the required performance can be reached, if the offline components used are carefully designed and optimized for the application in the High Level Trigger.

AB "IEEE BigData 2019 Cup: SuspiciousNetwork Event Recognition" was a data mining competition organized jointly by companies Security On -Demand and QED Software at the KnowledgePit online platform, in association with the IEEE BigData 2019 conference. The scope of this challenge referred to the notions of cybersecurity analytics and network alert evaluation. In this paper, we summarize the results of our competition. We explain how data sets had been prepared before it was possible to make them available to competition participants. We describe the baseline scoring models that we designed as a reference for participants, and we demonstrate how critical for their performance was the aspect of appropriate feature engineering. We also discuss the results of experiments conducted to verify the (un)suitability of deep recurrent neural networks in this particular case. In some sense, we show that there are no "perfect" machine learning approaches that could be applied equally successfully to every data science undertaking.

AB This paper describes the architecture and design of GridOPTICS (TM), a novel software framework for integrating a collection of software tools developed by PNNL's Future Power Grid Initiative (FPGI) into a coherent, powerful operations and planning tool for the power grid of the future. GridOPTICS (TM) enables plug-and-play of various analysis, modeling and visualization software tools to improve the efficiency and reliability of power grid. To bridge the data access for different control purposes, GridOPTICS (TM) provides a scalable, lightweight event processing layer that hides the complexity of data collection, storage, delivery and management. A significant challenge is the requirement to access large amount of data in real time. We address this challenge though a scalable system architecture that balances system performance and ease of integration. The initial prototype of GridOPTICS (TM) was demonstrated with several use cases from PNNL's FPGI and show that our system can provide real time data access to a diverse set of applications with easy to use APIs.

TI Efficient Recovery of Missing Events

AB For various entering and transmission issues raised by human or system, missing events often occur in event data, which record execution logs of business processes. Without recovering the missing events, applications such as provenance analysis or complex event processing built upon event data are not reliable. Following the minimum change discipline in improving data quality, it is also rational to find a recovery that minimally differs from the original data. Existing recovery approaches fall short of efficiency owing to enumerating and searching over all of the possible sequences of events. In this paper, we study the efficient techniques for recovering missing events. According to our theoretical results, the recovery problem appears to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, advanced indexing, pruning techniques are developed to further improve the recovery efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that our minimum recovery approach achieves high accuracy, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique for up to five orders of magnitudes improvement in time performance.

AB The STAR Experiment further exploits scalable message-oriented model principles to achieve a high level of control over online data streams. In this paper we present an AMQP-powered Message Interface and Reliable Architecture framework (MIRA), which allows STAR to orchestrate the activities of Meta-data Collection, Monitoring, Online QA and several Run-Time and Data Acquisition system components in a very efficient manner. The very nature of the reliable message bus suggests parallel usage of multiple independent storage mechanisms for our meta-data. We describe our experience with a robust data-taking setup employing MySQL- and HyperTable-based archivers for meta-data processing. In addition, MIRA has an AJAX-enabled web GUI, which allows real-time visualisation of online process flow and detector subsystem states, and doubles as a sophisticated alarm system when combined with complex event processing engines like Esper, Borealis or Cayuga. The performance data and our planned path forward are based on our experience during the 2011-2012 running of STAR.

AB Applications in the fields of virtual and augmented reality as well as image-guided medical applications make use of a wide variety of hardware devices. Existing frameworks for interconnecting low-level devices and high-level application programs do not exploit the full potential for processing events coming from arbitrary sources and are not easily generalizable. In this paper, we will introduce a new multi-modal event processing methodology using dynamically-typed event attributes for event passing between multiple devices and systems. The existing OpenTracker framework was modified to incorporate a highly flexible and extensible event model, which can store data that is dynamically created and arbitrarily typed at runtime. The main factors impacting the library's throughput were determined and the performance was shown to be sufficient for most typical applications. Several sample applications were developed to take advantage of the new dynamic event model provided by the library, thereby demonstrating its flexibility and expressive power.

AB Cyber physical systems (CPS) react to changes in the environment and have become widely adopted in many domains. One key functionality to achieve this reactivity is the processing of event streams. To profit from this reactive behavior in service-oriented architectures (SOA), event stream processing needs to be encapsulated in a service-like manner. We thus introduce the concept of event applets, in short Eventlets, to provide developers and architects alike with a generic and reusable component model for encapsulating event stream processing logic. Eventlets have a managed lifecycle and are activated automatically upon arrival of appropriate events. We introduce our distributed Eventlet middleware architecture and implementation based on industry-strength message-oriented middleware. Our evaluation shows that Eventlets simplify the development of reactive components and that they can compete with traditional event processing approaches in terms of performance. Eventlets enable easy distribution of event stream processing components and are a suitable foundation for scalable applications that combine SOA with CPS.

It also supports user defined event classes which can be used by implementors to build complex event systems as well as by application programmers who need to write customized monitors. BEE has been implemented for a variety of systems. One implementation based on a reliable message protocol is available on NECTAR, a network of workstations connected by optical fibers with a maximum throughput of 100 Mbit/sec. A TCP/IP based implementation has been ported to several machine architectures (Sun, Vax and Cray-YMP), supporting the instrumentation of C and Ada programs.
   The paper describes BEE's architecture, portrays some of the problems encountered during the various ports of BEE and demonstrates the cost associated with distributed heterogenous event processing.

AB Different from traditional video cameras, event cameras capture asynchronous events stream in which each event encodes pixel location, trigger time, and the polarity of the brightness changes. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based framework for event cameras, namely SlideGCN. Unlike some recent graph-based methods that use groups of events as input, our approach can efficiently process data event-by-event, unlock the low latency nature of events data while still maintaining the graph's structure internally. For fast graph construction, we develop a radius search algorithm, which better exploits the partial regular structure of event cloud against k-d tree based generic methods. Experiments show that our method reduces the computational complexity up to 100 times with respect to current graph-based methods while keeping state-of-the-art performance on object recognition. Moreover, we verify the superiority of event-wise processing with our method. When the state becomes stable, we can give a prediction with high confidence, thus making an early recognition.

AB The ATLAS High Level Trigger's (HLT) primary function of event selection will be accomplished with a Level-2 trigger farm and an event filter (EF) farm, both running software components developed in the ATLAS offline reconstruction framework. While this approach provides a unified software framework for event selection, it poses strict requirements on offline components critical for the Level-2 trigger. A Level-2 decision in ATLAS must typically be accomplished within 10 ms and with multiple event processing in concurrent threads. To address these constraints, prototypes have been developed that incorporate elements of the ATLAS data flow, high level trigger, and offline framework software. To realize a homogeneous software environment for offline components in the HLT, the Level-2 Steering Controller was developed. With electron/gamma- and muon-selection slices it has been shown that the required performance can be reached, if the offline components used are carefully designed and optimized for the application in the HLT.

AB This paper presents an approach for rapidly adjustable embedded trace online monitoring of multi-core systems, called RETOM. Today, most commercial multi-core SoCs provide accurate runtime information through an embedded trace unit without affecting program execution. Available debugging solutions can use it to reconstruct the run offline, but usually for up to a few seconds only. RETOM employs a novel online reconstruction technique that makes the program run available outside the SoC and allows for evaluating a specification formulated in the stream-based specification language TeSSLa in real time. The necessary computing performance is provided by an FPGA-based event processing system. In contrast to other hardware-based runtime verification techniques, changing the specification requires no circuit synthesis and thus seconds rather than minutes or hours. Therefore, iterated testing and property adjustment during development and debugging becomes feasible while preserving the option of arbitrarily extending observation time, which may be necessary to detect rarely occurring errors. Experiments show the feasibility of the approach.

AB In telecommunications network troubleshooting, analytical applications are widely used. Such applications typically use CEP (Complex Event Processing) and SQL queries for data processing and network analysis. Performance engineers need in-depth knowledge of both the telecommunications domain and telecommunications data structures in order to create the required queries. Moreover valuable information contained in free form text data fields such as "additional_info", "user_text" or "problem_text" can also be ignored. This work proposes CADMANT: Context Anomaly Detection for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting. Traditional approaches focus on a specific record type and create specific cause and effect rules. With the CADMANT approach all free form text fields of alarms, logs, etc. are treated as text documents similar to Twitter feeds. CADMANT uses distance based outlier detection within sliding windows to detect abnormal terms at configurable time intervals. The CADMANT approach provides automated analysis without the requirement for SQL/CEP queries and provides distinct network insights in comparison to traditional approaches.

AB Crystal Look-up table (CLT) used in the Siemens Inveon dedicated PET scanner defines the matching relation between signal position of a detected event to a corresponding detector pixel location. It is the result of the first stage scanner calibration and brings significant influence to the gantry overall performance. The currently used method involves a lot of human interaction for CLT corrections, and can not be implemented as an on-line process due to its complexity. This paper introduces a neural network based algorithm for crystal identification. A modified unsupervised self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by the incoming events to construct a CLT. The algorithm is implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip in the Inveon Event Processing Module (EPM) electronics, which significantly reduces the training time and brings feasibility to detector on-line monitoring. The preliminary training result shows that SOFM can be used effectively in CLT construction with excellent accuracy.

TI CREATOR - NEW ADVANCED CONCEPTS IN CONCURRENT SIMULATION
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
DT Article
AB Creator is a concurrent simulator for design verification and fault simulation of large circuits that highly integrates several traditional and innovative techniques. This is achieved by the introduction of a minimal information concept. Traditional techniques derived from previous works are Multiple List Traversal (MLT), trigger inhibition, fraternal event processing, list events, and clock suppression, whereas the new ideas are function lists and evaluation functions, persistence time, positioning algorithm, evaluation triggering algorithm, combination of Single List Traversal (SLT) and MLT, and the implementation of transport delay in fault simulation. Generally the concurrent algorithm increases in complexity and the implementations grow in size and lose in performance as soon as higher abstraction levels are added beyond the gate one. To overcome this limitation, all the Creator's techniques are not related to a specific abstraction level and lead to an intrinsic multilevel concurrent fault simulator. Experimental results are reported to compare Creator with our previous simulator and the state-of-the-art commercial simulator Verifault-XL on several platforms.

AB Intel recently released the first commercial boards of its Many Integrated Core (MIC) Architecture. MIC is Intel's solution for the domain of throughput computing, currently dominated by general purpose programming on graphics processors (GPGPU). MIC allows the use of the more familiar x86 programming model and supports standard technologies such as OpenMP, MPI, and Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB). This should make it possible to develop for both throughput and latency devices using a single code base. In ATLAS Software, track reconstruction has been shown to be a good candidate for throughput computing on GPGPU devices. In addition, the newly proposed offline parallel event-processing framework, GaudiHive, uses TBB for task scheduling. The MIC is thus, in principle, a good fit for this domain. In this paper, we report our experiences of porting to and optimizing ATLAS tracking algorithms for the MIC, comparing the programmability and relative cost/performance of the MIC against those of current GPGPUs and latency-optimized CPUs.

AB This paper describes a novel gesture interface based on a stereo pair of event-based vision sensors and neuromorphic event processing techniques. The motion trajectory of a moving hand is detected every 3 ms by spatiotemporally correlating the output events of the DVSs by using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons after the stereo vergence fusion. The trajectory of each gesture is automatically spotted by setting the threshold of LIF neurons, and, subsequently, sixteen feature vectors are extracted from each spotted gesture trajectory. The thresholds of LIF neurons are adaptively adjusted based on the disparity obtained from the stereovision to achieve distance invariant performance of gesture spotting. Gesture patterns were classified by using hidden Markov model (HMM)-based gesture models. The implemented system was tested with 6 subjects (3 untrained subjects and 3 trained subjects) producing continuous hand gestures (22 trials of 9 successive gestures for each subject). Achieved recognition rates ranged from 91.9 % to 99.5% depending on subject.

ID EFFICIENCY; CONSUMPTION
AB Increasing energy costs, new environmental legislation, and concerns over energy security are driving efforts to increase industrial energy efficiency across the European Union and the world. Manufacturers are keen to identify the most cost-effective techniques to increase energy efficiency in their factories. To achieve the desired efficiency improvements, energy use should be measured in more detail and in realtime, to derive an awareness of the energy use patterns of every part of the manufacturing system. In this paper, we propose a framework for energy monitoring and management in the factory. This will allow decision support systems and enterprise services to take into consideration the energy used by each individual productive asset and related energy using processes, to facilitate both global and local energy optimization. The proposed framework incorporates standards for energy data exchange, on-line energy data analysis, performance measurement and display of energy usage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims providing a quality of life to elderly for sustaining their lives without constant supervision. The technology developments enabled devices with more processing power, longer battery life and more advanced sensor capabilities. Internet of Things (IoT) is a phenomenon that allows seamless interconnection of very small devices over Internet; bringing new opportunities for AAL solutions. AAL systems equipped with IoT devices will generate vast amount of data in short time, thus a big data problem to mangle. This study proposes a simulation infrastructure that allows researchers to create their own AAL scenarios without real devices, and a system architecture to tackle the big data problem that is inferred by utilization of IoT in AAL systems. In order to understand feasibility of the architecture we conduct a performance experiment, in which we increase the number of messages that the system can handle per second. The resulst of the experiment are promising.

AB According to cognitive models, post-event processing (PEP) is a key factor in the maintenance of social anxiety. Given that decreasing PEP can be challenging for socially anxious individuals, it is important to identify potentially useful strategies. Although distraction may help to decrease PEP, the findings have been equivocal. The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether a brief distraction period immediately following a speech would lead to less PEP the next day. The secondary aim was to examine the effect of distraction following an initial speech on anticipatory anxiety for a second speech, via reductions in PEP. Participants (N=77 undergraduates with elevated social anxiety; 67.53% female) delivered a speech and were randomly assigned to a distraction, rumination, or control condition. The following day, participants reported levels of PEP in relation to the first speech, as well as anxiety regarding a second, upcoming speech. As expected, those in the distraction condition reported less PEP than those in the rumination and control conditions. Additionally, distraction following the first speech was indirectly related to anticipatory anxiety for the second speech, via PEP. Distraction may represent a potentially useful strategy for reducing PEP and other maladaptive processes that may maintain social anxiety.

AB The present study investigated the factors that influence the likelihood that individuals engage in post-event processing (PEP)-the act of engaging in a detailed, negative, and self-focused review following social situations. This study also examined the cognitive contents of PEP in a nonclinical sample (N = 40). Participants undertook both a 5-min speech and conversation and then completed measures assessing cognitions, behaviours, and physiological processes that occurred during each task. Twenty-four hours later, PEP was measured in relation to both tasks. Results showed firstly that PEP was greater following the speech than the conversation. Secondly, negative assumptions were found to be a unique predictor of PEP over and above depression, trait anxiety, and other cognitive-behavioural variables. Finally, higher levels of social anxiety were associated with experiencing more negative self-perceptions and regret-based cognitions during PEP. Current findings underscore the importance of targeting negative assumptions, self-related cognitions, and regret-based thoughts in therapy.

AB The widespread of Internet of Things (IoT) and the price reduction and ubiquity of telecommunications has led to the emergence of smart environments where devices are becoming increasingly smarter and everything is connected and from which society aims to benefit. The data obtained from IoT is rapidly processed in various domains for the achievement of smart cities and societies. However, in many cases, applications are not contextualized by using data from outside the domain but are only contextualized using data from the domain itself, missing the opportunity for further contextualization. The lack of common criteria for the integration of data from different application domains is one of the main reasons that significantly hinders the integration of third-party data into real-time processing and decision-making systems and thus, the context awareness of developed applications. Although the use of several taxonomies and ontologies for context awareness in various application domains have been proposed, in many cases they are highly domain specific and/or difficult to integrate with other systems, which makes it challenging to facilitate data sharing between different systems and their processing to achieve enhanced context awareness. We aim to contribute to the addressing of these limitations through a reusable and extensible multi-domain taxonomy targeted to collaborative IoT and smart environments, which is also automatically integrated into a software architecture with real-time complex event processing technologies. The proposed solution has been illustrated through a case study and performance tests have been carried out in different computing capacity scenarios, showing its feasibility and usefulness.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly to become the core of many areas of application, leading to the integration of sensors, with IoT devices. However, the number of attacks against these types of devices has grown as fast as the paradigm itself. Certain inherent characteristics of the paradigm, as well as the limited computational capabilities of the devices involved, make it difficult to deploy security measures. This is why it is necessary to design, implement and study new solutions in the field of cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose an architecture that is capable of generating Complex Event Processing (CEP) rules automatically by integrating them with machine learning technologies. While the former is used to automatically detect attack patterns in real time, the latter, through the use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, allows the characterization of events and the recognition of anomalies. This combination makes it possible to achieve efficient CEP rules at the computational level, with the results showing that the CEP rules obtained using our approach substantially improve upon the performance of the standard CEP rules, which are rules that are not generated by our proposal but can be defined independently by an expert in the field. Our proposal has achieved an F1-score of 0.98 on average, a 76 percent improvement in throughput over standard CEP rules, and a reduction in the network overhead of 86 percent over standard simple events, which are the simple events that are generated when our proposal is not used.

AB Individuals with social anxiety are prone to engage in post event processing (PEP), a post mortem review of a social interaction that focuses on negative elements. The extent that PEP is impacted by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the relation between PEP and change during treatment has yet to be evaluated in a controlled study. The current study used multilevel modeling to determine if PEP decreased as a result of treatment and if PEP limits treatment response for two types of cognitive behavioral treatments, a group-based cognitive behavioral intervention and individually based virtual reality exposure. These hypotheses were evaluated using 91 participants diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. The findings suggested that PEP decreased as a result of treatment, and that social anxiety symptoms for individuals reporting greater levels of PEP improved at a slower rate than those with lower levels of PEP. Further research is needed to understand why PEP attenuates response to treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the capability of computer-based artificial intelligence techniques for decision-making and situational awareness has seen notable improvement over the last several decades, the current state-of-the-art still falls short of creating computer systems capable of autonomously making complex decisions and judgments in many domains where data is nuanced and accountability is high. However, there is a great deal of potential for hybrid systems in which software applications augment human capabilities by focusing the analyst's attention to relevant information elements based on both a priori knowledge of the analyst's goals and the processing/correlation of a series of data streams too numerous and heterogeneous for the analyst to digest without assistance.
   Researchers at Penn State University are exploring ways in which an information framework influenced by Klein's (Recognition Primed Decision) RPD model, Endsley's model of situational awareness, and the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion process model can be implemented through a novel combination of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Multi-Agent Software (MAS). Though originally designed for stock market and financial applications, the high performance data-driven nature of CEP techniques provide a natural compliment to the proven capabilities of MAS systems for modeling naturalistic decision-making, performing process adjudication, and optimizing networked processing and cognition via the use of "mobile agents." This paper addresses the challenges and opportunities of such a framework for augmenting human observational capability as well as enabling the ability to perform collaborative context-aware reasoning in both human teams and hybrid human /software agent teams.

AB The number of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices capable of producing, consuming and exchanging information is constantly increasing. It is estimated there will be around 30 billion of them in 2020. In most cases, the structures of the information produced by such devices are completely different, thus providing heterogeneous information. This is becoming a challenge for researchers working on IoT, who need to perform homogenisation and pre-processing tasks before using the IoT data. This paper aims to provide an architecture for processing and analysing data from heterogeneous sources with different structures in IoT scopes, allowing researchers to focus on data analysis, without having to worry about the structure of the data sources. This architecture combines the real-time stream processing paradigm for information processing and transforming, together with the complex event processing for information analysis. This provides us with capability of processing, transforming and analysing large amounts of information in real time. The results obtained from the evaluation of a real-world case study about water supply network management show that the architecture can be applied to an IoT water management scenario to analyse the information in real time. Additionally, the stress tests successfully conducted for this architecture highlight that a large incoming rate of input events could be processed without latency, resulting in efficient performance of the proposed architecture. This novel software architecture is adequate for automatically detecting situations of interest in the IoT through the processing, transformation and analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous information in real time.Y

AB A major obstacle in performing listmode reconstruction in PET imaging is the increased computation time compared to a conventional frame or histogrammed reconstruction. To overcome this challenge in a clinical setting, it is desirable to distribute the reconstruction task to multiple nodes. A previous work investigated the impact of high performance communication networks and focused mainly on static distribution. In practice, optimal static load balancing is difficult. Therefore we have developed a dynamic load balancing approach, which is flexible and can easily be adapted to a varying number of nodes, and the performance of which is not constrained by variation of the load levels of nodes needed for other tasks or by asymmetric network. In this approach, one of the nodes is designated as the distributor, whose task is to partition the events into small chunks and then distribute those chunks to other nodes for processing. Other nodes, which do the actual data processing, are called workers. Each worker requests a new chunk of data to process upon completion of an old one. In case of the OSEM algorithm, when all chunks have been processed in a subset, the workers are synchronized and the image is updated. This image forms the basis for the next subset. This system has been deployed in the Philips GEMINI-TF PET/CT system. For a whole-body patient scan of 150M events, the event processing time with 8 Xeon 3.6GHz dual-processor computers amounts to approximately 9 minutes for 3 iterations.

AB Increasing supply chain complexity poses new challenges to managers. On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology. Future research should focus on the topics of standardization, granularity, data sources, and cooperation. Moreover, holistic event processing supported by big data and machine learning techniques could create interfaces with other legacy business intelligence applications. Another promising area includes the exploration of new technologies, i.e. IoT, to enable new smart solutions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The limitations of traditional general-purpose processors have motivated the use of specialized hardware solutions (e.g., FPGAs) to achieve higher performance in stream processing. However, state-of-the-art hardware-only solutions have limited support to adapt to changes in the query workload.
   In this work, we present a reconfigurable hardware-based streaming architecture that offers the flexibility to accept new queries and to change existing ones without the need for expensive hardware reconfiguration. We introduce the Online Programmable Block (OP-Block), a "Lego-like" connectable stream processing element, for constructing a custom Flexible Query Processor (FQP), suitable to a wide range of data streaming applications, including real-time data analytics, information filtering, intrusion detection, algorithmic trading, targeted advertising, and complex event processing.
   Through evaluations, we conclude that updating OP-Blocks to support new queries takes on the order of nano to micro-seconds (e.g., 40 ns to realize a join operator on an OP-Block), a feature critical to support of streaming applications on FPGAs.

AB Quality of Service (QoS) information for Web services is essential to QoS-aware service management and composition. Currently, most QoS-aware solutions assume that the QoS for component services is readily available, and that the QoS for composite services can be computed from the QoS for component services. The issue of how to obtain the QoS for component services has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we tackle this fundamental issue. We argue that most of QoS metrics can be observed/computed based on service operations. We present the design and implementation of a high-performance QoS monitoring system. The system is driven by a QoS observation model that defines IT- and business-level metrics and associated evaluation formulas. Integrated into the SOA infrastructure at large, the monitoring system can detect and route service operational events systemically. Further, a model-driven, hybrid compilation/interpretation approach is used in metric computation to process service operational events and maintain metrics efficiently. Experiments suggest that our system can support high event processing throughput and scales to the number of CPUs.

AB Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that mimic retinas to asynchronously report per-pixel intensity changes rather than outputting an actual intensity image at regular intervals. This new paradigm of image sensor offers significant potential advantages; namely, sparse and nonredundant data representation. Unfortunately, however, most of the existing artificial neural network architectures, such as a CNN, require dense synchronous input data, and therefore, cannot make use of the sparseness of the data. We propose EventNet, a neural network designed for real-time processing of asynchronous event streams in a recursive and event-wise manner. EventNet models dependence of the output on tens of thousands of causal events recursively using a novel temporal coding scheme. As a result, at inference time, our network operates in an event-wise manner that is realized with very few sum-of-the-product operations- look-up table and temporal feature aggregation-which enables processing of I mega or more events per second on standard CPU. In experiments using real data, we demonstrated the real-time performance and robustness of our framework.

AB The PATH2iot open-source platform presents a new approach to stream processing for Internet of Things applications by automatically partitioning and deploying the computation over the available infrastructure (e.g. cloud, field gateways and sensors) in order to meet non-functional requirements including energy, performance and security. The user gives a high-level declarative description of computation in the form of Event Processing Language queries. These are compiled, optimised, and partitioned to meet the non-functional requirements using database system techniques and cost models extended to meet the needs of IoT analytics. The paper describes the PATH2iot system, illustrated by a real-world digital healthcare analytics example, with sensor battery life as the main non-functional requirement to be optimised. It shows that the tool can automatically partition and distribute the computation across a healthcare wearable, a mobile phone and the cloud-increasing the battery life of the smart watch by 453% when compared to other possible allocations. The PATH2iot system can therefore automatically bring the benefits of fog/edge computing to IoT applications.

AB The authors designed in asynchronous messaging platform to facilitate tile development of context-aware services that arc triggered by state judgment results (contexts) obtained by using Multiple kinds of infomation from different g,encration sources in an environment where information providers, who actively disseminate information, and inforniation holders, who provide information according to requests, persistently exist oil a network. This platform also uses information that is obtained by using synchronous inquiries to calculate tile activation triggers that arc sought by the service providers in a distributed environment and provide these triggers to the application logic,_,ic without destroying the asynchronous information generation order. In addition, the authors adaptcd this platform to a ubiquitous computing environment according to a design that takes into consideration large-scale distribution. They measured tile basic performance of this platform and obtained measurernent results showing that tile platform can support a large-scale increase in the number of participating nodes and volume of circulating messages.

AB We present the results of a detailed study of the Virtual Interface (VI) paradigm as a communication foundation for a distributed computing environment. Using Active Messages and the Split-C global memory model, we analyze the inherent costs of using VI primitives to implement these high-level communication abstractions. We demonstrate a minimum mapping cost (i.e. the host processing required to map one abstraction to a lower abstraction) of 5.4 mus for both Active Messages and Split-C using four-way 550 MHz Pentium III SMPs and the Myrinet network. We break down this cost to the use of individual VI primitives in supporting flow control, buffer management and event processing and identify the completion queue as the source of the highest overhead. Bulk transfer performance plateaus at 44 Mbytes/s for both implementations are due to the addition of fragmentation requirements. Based on this analysis, we present the implications for the VI successor, Infiniband. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a new collaboration abstraction, called Semantic Room (SR), specifically targeted to facilitating sharing and processing large volumes of data produced and consumed in real time by a collection of networked participants. The model enables constructing flexible collaborative event-driven distributed systems with well-defined and contractually regulated properties and behavior. The contract determines the set of services provided by SR, the software and hardware resources required for its operation along with a collection of non-functional requirements, such as, data protection, isolation, trust, security, availability, fault-tolerance, and performance. We show how the SR model can be leveraged for creating trusted information processing systems for the sake of protecting financial institutions against coordinated security threats (e.g., stealthy scans, worm outbreaks, Distributed Denial of Service). To this end, we present several use-cases demonstrating a variety of the SR administration task flows, and briefly discuss possible ways of implementing the SR abstraction using the collaborative intrusion detection as an example.

AB Due to the intelligent, adaptive nature of various operations and their ability to provide maximum comfort to the occupants residing in them, smart buildings are becoming a pioneering area of research. Since these architectures leverage the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for monitoring different operations (occupancy, humidity etc.) to provide sustainable comfort to the occupants. This work proposes a novel approach for intelligent building operations monitoring using rule-based complex event processing (CEP) and query-based approaches for dynamically monitoring the operations. Siddhi is a CEP engine designed for handling multiple sources of events data in real time and processing it according to predefined rules using a decision tree. Since datastream is dynamic in nature, to keep track of different operations, we have converted the IoT data into an RDF (Resource Description Framework) dataset. The RDF dataset is ingested to Apache Kafka for streaming and for stored data we have used GraphDB tool that extracts information with the help of SPARQL query. Additionally, a large number of events are passed through CEP for correlating and analyzing events in real time, and we measure the performance of CEP engines through SPARQL for enhancing decision support. The proposed approach is evaluated by deploying rules to events through the CEP engine and assessing their processing efficiency in terms of time. Subsequently, a risk estimation scenario is proposed to generate alerts for end users if any smart building operations need immediate attention. However, the proposed work has limitations regarding adaptive and standard parameters, which may cause the rules to fail in adapting to changing data streams.

AB The analysis of the ECG can benefit from the wide availability of computing technology as far as features and performances as well. This paper presents some results achieved by carrying out the classification tasks of a possible equipment integrating the most common features of the ECG analysis: arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, chronic alterations. Several ANN architectures are implemented, tested, and compared with competing alternatives. Approach, structure, and learning algorithm of ANN were designed according to the features of each particular classification task, The trade-off between the time consuming training of ANN's and their performances is also explored. Data pre-and post-processing efforts on the system performance were critically tested. These efforts' crucial role on the reduction of the input space dimensions, on a more significant description of the input features, and on improving new or ambiguous event processing has been also documented. Finally the algorithm assessment was done on data coming from all the currently available ECG databases.

AB This paper describes the design of a coincidence processing board for a dual-head Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner for breast imaging. The proposed block-oriented data acquisition system relies on a high-speed DSP processor for fully digital trigger and on-line event processing that surpasses the performance of traditional analog coincidence detection systems. A mixed-signal board has been designed and manufactured. The analog section comprises 12 coaxial inputs (six per head) which are digitized by means of two 8-channel 12-bit 40-MHz ADCs in order to acquire the scintillation pulse, the charge division signals and the depth of interaction within the scintillator. At the digital section, a state-of-the-art FPGA is used as deserializer and also implements the DMA interface to the DSP processor by storing each digitized channel into a fast embedded FIFO memory. The system incorporates a high-speed USB 2.0 interface to the host computer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI On asynchronous eventful session semantics
SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
DT Article
ID CALCULUS; PROGRESS
AB Event-driven programming is one of the major paradigms in concurrent and communication-based programming, where events are typically detected as the arrival of messages on asynchronous channels. Unfortunately, the flexibility and performance of traditional event-driven programming come at the cost of more complex programs: low-level APIs and the obfuscation of event-driven control flow make programs difficult to read, write and verify.
   This paper introduces a p-calculus with session types that models event-driven session programming (called ESP) and studies its behavioural theory. The main characteristics of the ESP model are asynchronous, order-preserving message passing, non-blocking detection of event/message arrivals and dynamic inspection of session types. Session types offer formal safety guarantees, such as communication and event handling safety, and programmatic benefits that overcome problems with existing event-driven programming languages and techniques. The new typed bisimulation theory developed for the ESP model is distinct from standard synchronous or asynchronous bisimulation, capturing the semantic nature of eventful session-based processes. The bisimilarity coincides with reduction-closed barbed congruence.
   We demonstrate the features and benefits of ESP and the behavioural theory through two key use cases. First, we examine an encoding and the semantic behaviour of the event selector, a central component of general event-driven systems, providing core results for verifying type-safe event-driven applications. Second, we examine the Lauer-Needham duality, building on the selector encoding and bisimulation theory to prove that a systematic transformation from multithreaded to event-driven session processes is type-and semantics-preserving.

AB Background: Research on post-event processing (PEP), where individuals conduct a postmortem evaluation of a social situation, has focused primarily on its relationship with social anxiety. Aims: The current study examined: 1) levels of PEP for a standardized event in different anxiety disorders; 2) the relationship between peak anxiety levels during this event and subsequent PEP; and 3) the relationship between PEP and disorder-specific symptom severity. Method: Participants with primary DSM-IV diagnoses of social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/A), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) completed diagnosis specific symptom measures before attending group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specific to their diagnosis. Participants rated their peak anxiety level during the first group therapy session, and one week later rated PEP in the context of CBT. Results: The results indicated that all anxiety disorder groups showed heightened and equivalent PEP ratings. Peak state anxiety during the first CBT session predicted subsequent level of PEP, irrespective of diagnostic group. PEP ratings were found to be associated with disorder-specific symptom severity in SAD, GAD, and PD/A, but not in OCD. Conclusions: PEP may be a transdiagnostic process with relevance to a broad range of anxiety disorders, not just SAD.

AB Iot is becoming a hot spot area of technological innovations and economic development promises for many in-dustries and services. This new paradigm shift affects all the enterprise architecture layers from infrastructure to business. Business Process Management (BPM) is a field among others that is affected by this new technology. To assist data and events ex-plosion resulting, among others, from IoT, data analytic processes combined with event processing techniques, examine large data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations between collected events, either at a very technical level (incident/anomaly detection, predictive maintenance) or at business level (customer preferences, market trends, revenue opportunities) to provide improved operational efficiency, better customer service and competitive advantages over rival organizations. In order to capitalize the business value of data and events generated by IoT sensors, IoT, Data Analytics and BPM need to meet in the middle. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end IoT-BPM integration architecture (IoDEP: IoT-Data-Event-Process) for a proactive business process incident management. A case study is presented and the obtained results from our experimentations demonstrate the benefit of our approach and allowed us to confirm the efficiency of our assumptions.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates creation of smart spaces by converting existing environments into sensor-rich data-centric cyber-physical systems with an increasing degree of automation, giving rise to Industry 4.0. When adopted in commercial/industrial contexts, this trend is revolutionising many aspects of our everyday life, including the way people access and receive healthcare services. As we move towards Healthcare Industry 4.0, the underlying IoT systems of Smart Healthcare spaces are growing in size and complexity, making it important to ensure that extreme amounts of collected data are properly processed to provide valuable insights and decisions according to requirements in place. This paper focuses on the Smart Healthcare domain and addresses the issue of data fusion in the context of IoT networks, consisting of edge devices, network and communications units, and Cloud platforms. We propose a distributed hierarchical data fusion architecture, in which different data sources are combined at each level of the IoT taxonomy to produce timely and accurate results. This way, mission-critical decisions, as demonstrated by the presented Smart Healthcare scenario, are taken with minimum time delay, as soon as necessary information is generated and collected. The proposed approach was implemented using the Complex Event Processing technology, which natively supports the hierarchical processing model and specifically focuses on handling streaming data 'on the fly'-a key requirement for storage-limited IoT devices and time-critical application domains. Initial experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach enables fine-grained decision taking at different data fusion levels and, as a result, improves the overall performance and reaction time of public healthcare services, thus promoting the adoption of the IoT technologies in Healthcare Industry 4.0.

AB Composite (or Complex) event processing (CEP) systems search sequences of incoming events for occurrences of user-specified event patterns. Recently, they have gained more attention in a variety of areas due to their powerful and expressive query language and performance potential. Sequentiality (temporal ordering) is the primary way in which CEP systems relate events to each other. In this paper, we present a CEP system called ZStrearn to efficiently process such sequential patterns. Besides simple sequential patterns, ZStream is also able to detect other patterns, including conjunction, disjunction, negation and Kleene closure.
   Unlike most recently proposed CEP systems, which use non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) to detect patterns, ZStream uses tree-based query plans for both the logical and physical representation of query patterns. By carefully designing the underlying infrastructure and algorithms, ZStream is able to unify the evaluation of sequence, conjunction, disjunction, negation, and Kleene closure as variants of the join operator. Under this framework, a single pattern in ZStream may have several equivalent physical tree plans, with different evaluation costs. We propose a cost model to estimate the computation costs of a plan. We show that our cost model can accurately capture the actual runtime behavior of a plan, and that choosing the optimal plan can result in a factor of four or more speedup versus an NFA based approach. Based on this cost model and using a simple set of statistics about operator selectivity and data rates, ZStream is able to adaptively and seamlessly adjust the order in which it detects patterns on the fly. Finally, we describe a dynamic programming algorithm used in our cost model to efficiently search for an optimal query plan for a given pattern.

AB The QuickSilver Event Routing Subsystem (ERS) is a new CompactPCI card developed as part of a new high performance data acquisition platform from Siemens Molecular Imaging (Knoxville, TN). The card's main purpose is to route event data from the QuickSilver Event Processing Modules (EPM) out to either IEEE 1394A or PCI data collection channels. To accomplish this task, an ERS uses eight 2.0 gigabit/second serial links to the EPM backplane to receive incoming data, an outgoing 32 megabyte/second IEEE 1394A link, and an outgoing PCI interface capable of 200 megabytes/second. The card's secondary purpose is to facilitate insertion of real-time system tagword information into the outgoing data stream such as time marks, physiological gating events, and motion axis positions. The ERS is built around a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA which performs on-the-fly event packet prioritization, format translation, and flow control. This architecture allows the ERS to process up to 33 million single or coincident events per second while guaranteeing the integrity of tagword packets.

AB Cognitive agents are typically utilized in autonomous systems for automated decision making. These systems interact in real time with their environments and are generally heavily power constrained. Thus there is a strong need for a real time agent running on a low power computing platform for these systems. This paper examines how some of the components of a cognitive agent can be mapped onto the IBM TrueNorth neurosynaptic system to achieve real time performance at low power. The agent examined is the Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture. Although it is geared towards autonomous decision making, CECEP also has applications in operations research, intelligence analysis, and data mining. One of the key components of CECEP is the Cognitive Domain Ontology (CDO), used for mining decisions from a large knowledge repository based on situational inputs and constraints. As CDOs are the most time and power consuming part of CECEP, we implemented them on the TrueNorth processor by mapping the solution space of CDOs into a pattern matching form.

ID MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) introduce significant flexibility in the management of smart buildings. The elimination of wires allows to deploy battery-powered sensor and actuator nodes everywhere in both new, old and historical buildings. Thus, WSNs can allow to monitor the building structural health, to manage electric loads for energy saving, to control the comfort environmental conditions, to help building inhabitants with safety procedures. The use of management frameworks (both general-purpose and domain-specific) is very important for this kind of networks as they transparently introduce characteristics such as efficient organization of the nodes, fast reconfiguration of the network, battery consumption optimization, and low-level and high-level data and event processing. The aim of this paper is to introduce an evaluation framework for the comparative analysis of systems that allow the management of Building WSNs. Specifically, a set of both qualitative and quantitative (performance evaluation) indicators have been defined on the basis of a study of the state of the art. Finally, the defined framework is used to evaluate the Building Management Framework system.

AB Nowadays, robust and accurate odometries, as the foundation technology of navigation systems, gains significance in autonomous driving and robotic navigation fields. Although odometries, especially visual odometries (VOs), have made substantial progress, their application scenarios are still limited by the normal cameras' frame rate limitations and their low robustness to motion blur. The event camera, a recently proposed bionic sensor, seeks to tackle these challenges, offering new possibilities for VO solutions to overcome extreme environments. However, integrating event cameras into VO faces challenges like the RGB-event modality gap and the requirement for efficient event processing. To address these research gaps to some extent, we propose a novel visual-event odometry, namely MC-VEO (Motion Compensated Visual-Event Odometry). Specifically, by introducing the temporal Gaussian weight into the standard contrast maximization framework, we propose the first effective 6-DoF motion compensation method that generates deblurred event frames from event data without additional sensors. The generated frames then be aligned with the RGB images through Event Generation Model (EGM) in MC-VEO, so as to overcome the RGB-event modality gap. Additionally, during the optimization of the EGM-based motion estimation algorithm, our decoupling and pre-calculation, matrix representation, and parallel solving further accelerate the per-point processing of events, which enables MC-VEO to show satisfactory speed performance even when facing large amounts of events and candidate points. The superior performance of MC-VEO is evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative experimental results. To ensure that our results are fully reproducible, all the relevant data and codes have been released publicly.

AB As technology evolves, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining more importance for constituting a foundation to reach better connectivity between people and things. For this to happen, certain strategies and processes are considered to enhance and grant optimal interoperability between the heterogenous devices of a typical IoT network. Two major key aspects of these networks are autonomous error recovery and network reorganization, which are usually based on physical redundancy and aim to return the network to a similar working state, as it was before the error. This process is of great importance when regarding the amount of data and devices that the ever-growing IoT networks have to manage and the number of situations that are associated with this aspect. This work proposes a solution to integrate the previously mentioned processes in IoT networks with the support of semantic maps as a mean to accomplish redundancy. It uses network metadata and a function-oriented recovery methodology to provide the network the tools to be more autonomous and reliable, without compromising performance.

AB Scene graph generation aims to capture the semantic elements in images by modelling objects and their relationships in a structured manner, which are essential for visual understanding and reasoning tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, multimedia event processing, visual storytelling and image retrieval. The existing scene graph generation approaches provide limited performance and expressiveness for higher-level visual understanding and reasoning. This challenge can be mitigated by leveraging commonsense knowledge, such as related facts and background knowledge, about the semantic elements in scene graphs. In this paper, we propose the infusion of diverse commonsense knowledge about the semantic elements in scene graphs to generate rich and expressive scene graphs using a heterogeneous knowledge source that contains commonsense knowledge consolidated from seven different knowledge bases. The graph embeddings of the object nodes are used to leverage their structural patterns in the knowledge source to compute similarity metrics for graph refinement and enrichment. We performed experimental and comparative analysis on the benchmark Visual Genome dataset, in which the proposed method achieved a higher recall rate (R@K = 29.89, 35.4, 39.12 for K = 20, 50, 100) as compared to the existing state-of-the-art technique (R@K = 25.8, 33.3, 37.8 for K = 20, 50, 100). The qualitative results of the proposed method in a downstream task of image generation showed that more realistic images are generated using the commonsense knowledge-based scene graphs. These results depict the effectiveness of commonsense knowledge infusion in improving the performance and expressiveness of scene graph generation for visual understanding and reasoning tasks.

AB Given the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC Upgrade, the performance requirements for the trigger systems associated with the LHC experiments will increase due to the larger volume of data to be processed. One of the possibilities that the ATLAS Collaboration is evaluating for upgrading the software-based portion of its trigger system is the use of Graphical Processing Units as hardware accelerators. The present work focuses on the GPU acceleration of the Topological Clustering algorithm, which is used to reconstruct calorimeter showers by grouping cells according to their signal-to-noise ratio. A more GPU parallelizable version of the Topological Clustering, called Topo-Automaton Clustering, was implemented within AthenaMT, the software framework of the ATLAS trigger, and its results were compared to those of the standard CPU algorithm to ensure physical validity is maintained. Time measurements suggest an average improvement of the event processing time by a factor between 3.5 and 5.5 (depending on the kind of the event), though less than 20% of that time corresponds to the algorithm itself, suggesting that the main bottleneck lies in data transfers and conversions.

AB Event matching is a critical component of large-scale content-based publish/subscribe systems. However, most existing methods suffer from a dramatic performance degradation when the system scales up. In this paper, we present TAMA (TAble MAtch), a highly efficient content-based event matching and forwarding engine. We consider range-based attribute constraints that are widely used in real-world applications. TAMA employs approximate matching to provide fast event matching against an enormous amount of subscriptions. To this end, TAMA uses a hierarchical indexing table to store subscriptions. Event matching in TAMA becomes the query to this table, which is substantially faster than traditional methods. In addition, the false positive rate of matching events in TAMA can be adjusted by tuning the size of the matching table, which makes TAMA favorable in practice. We implement TAMA as a forwarding component in Siena and conduct extensive experiments with realistic settings. The results demonstrate that TAMA has a significantly faster event matching speed compared to existing methods, and only incurs a small fraction of false positives.

AB Theoretical models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) have identified several cognitive factors (fear of negative evaluation [FNE], self-perception, self-esteem, and post-event processing [PEP]) that play a role in the maintenance of the disorder. The current study aimed at testing both the cognitive factors addressed in these different models and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) in the same construct. A non-clinical emerging adulthood sample (N = 325) were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the SEM showed that FPE, FNE, and self-concepts (self-esteem and self-perception) were significantly associated with social anxiety. Effect sizes indicated that the variables that most affected social anxiety were FPE, self-perception, FNE, and self-esteem, respectively. However, although it was significant in the conceptual model, the direct effect of social anxiety on PEP was not significant in the full model. On the other hand, the present findings add further support to the roles of negative self-perception and low self-esteem in social anxiety. Moreover, FPE may not be just delayed/postponed FNE. Considering the effect size of FPE on social anxiety, targeting it when appropriate in treatment may reduce the severity of social anxiety.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Our brain receives a dynamically changing stream of sensorimotor data. Yet, we perceive a rather organized world, which we segment into and perceive as events. Computational theories of cognitive science on event-predictive cognition suggest that our brain forms generative, event-predictive models by segmenting sensorimotor data into suitable chunks of contextual experiences. Here, we introduce a hierarchical, surprise-gated recurrent neural network architecture, which models this process and develops compact compressions of distinct event-like contexts. The architecture contains a contextual LSTM layer, which develops generative compressions of ongoing and subsequent contexts. These compressions are passed to a GRU-like layer, which uses surprise signals to update its recurrent latent state. The latent state is passed on to another LSTM layer, which processes actual dynamic sensory flow in the light of the provided latent, contextual compression signals. Our model develops distinct event compressions and achieves the best performance on multiple event processing tasks. The architecture may be very useful for the further development of resource-efficient learning, hierarchical model-based reinforcement learning, as well as the development of artificial event-predictive cognition and intelligence.

AB The in-beam positron emission tomography (ibPET) is dedicated to radiotherapy imaging of the heavy-ion medical machine (HIMM), which requires precise online measurement, as well as real-time signal processing capability of the electronics. In this paper, we present the implementation of real-time digital signal processing in the data acquisition unit (DAQU) for an ibPET system based on the photomultiplier tube (PMT) readout of lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) scintillator crystals. We have designed 10-channel customized signal processing circuit on a high-performance FPGA, which supports 3 working modes (single event processing mode, self-calibration mode and raw ADC data mode), position calculation, crystal locating, event sorting, and etc. Moreover, the implementation of real-time corrections is capable of dealing with photon peak correction to 511 keV and crystal ID-based time correction. The implemented real-time ibPET system can achieve 46% data compression and beyond 1,000,000 events/sec/channel signal processing capabilities. A series of initial tests is conducted, and the results indicate that this design meets the application requirement on online processing.

AB Sensor networks have become ubiquitous - being present from personal smartphones to smart cities deployments - and are producing large volumes of data at increasing rates. Distributed event stream processing systems, in its turn, are a specific kind of systems that help us to parallelize event processing. Therefore, they provide us capabilities to produce quick insights and decisions, in near real-time, on top of multiple data streams.
   However, current systems for large scale processing do not focus on Internet of Things and Sensor Network workloads, which makes the performance decrease quickly as the workload size increases. In order to process large scale events with acceptable latency percentiles and high throughput, special systems are needed, such as distributed event stream processing systems.
   In this work, we propose an architecture for Internet of Things data workloads, in a combination of sensor networks data sources and distributed event stream processing systems, focused on smart grid data profiles. In our evaluations, the system was able to process up to 45K messages per second using 8 processing nodes, while providing stable latencies for micro-batches above 30 seconds.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Compton imaging is the main method for locating radioactive hot spots emitting high-energy gamma ray photons. In particular, this imaging method is crucial when the photon energy is too high for coded mask aperture imaging methods to be effective or when a large field of view is required. Reconstruction of the photon source requires advanced Compton event processing algorithms to determine the exact position of the source. In this study, we introduce a novel method based on a Deep Learning algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform Compton imaging. This algorithm is trained on simulated data and tested on real data acquired with Caliste, a single planar CdTe pixelated detector. We show that performance in terms of source location accuracy is equivalent to state-of-the-art algorithms, while computation time is significantly reduced and sensitivity is improved by a factor of-5 in the Caliste configuration.

AB The repeated execution of reasoning tasks is desirable in many applicative scenarios, such as stream reasoning and event processing. When using answer set programming in such contexts, one can avoid the iterative generation of ground programs thus achieving a significant payoff in terms of computing time. However, this may require some additional amount of memory and/or the manual addition of operational directives in the declarative knowledge base at hand. We introduce a new strategy for generating series of monotonically growing propositional programs. The proposedovergrounded programs with tailoring(OPTs) can be updated and reused in combination with consecutive inputs. With respect to earlier approaches, ourtailored simplificationtechnique reduces the size of instantiated programs. A maintained OPT slowly grows in size from an iteration to another while the update cost decreases, especially in later iterations. In this paper we formally introduce tailored embeddings, a family of equivalence-preserving ground programs which are at the theoretical basis of OPTs and we describe their properties. We then illustrate an OPT update algorithm and report about our implementation and its performance.

AB The event sensor provides high temporal resolution and generates large amounts of raw event data. Efficient low-complexity coding solutions are required for integration into low-power event-processing chips with limited memory. In this paper, a novel lossless compression method is proposed for encoding the event data represented as asynchronous event sequences. The proposed method employs only low-complexity coding techniques so that it is suitable for hardware implementation into low-power event-processing chips. A first, novel, contribution consists of a low-complexity coding scheme which uses a decision tree to reduce the representation range of the residual error. The decision tree is formed by using a triplet threshold parameter which divides the input data range into several coding ranges arranged at concentric distances from an initial prediction, so that the residual error of the true value information is represented by using a reduced number of bits. Another novel contribution consists of an improved representation, which divides the input sequence into same-timestamp subsequences, wherein each subsequence collects the same timestamp events in ascending order of the largest dimension of the event spatial information. The proposed same-timestamp representation replaces the event timestamp information with the same-timestamp subsequence length and encodes it together with the event spatial and polarity information into a different bitstream. Another novel contribution is the random access to any time window by using additional header information. The experimental evaluation on a highly variable event density dataset demonstrates that the proposed low-complexity lossless coding method provides an average improvement of 5.49%, 11.45%, and 35.57% compared with the state-of-the-art performance-oriented lossless data compression codecs Bzip2, LZMA, and ZLIB, respectively. To our knowledge, the paper proposes the first low-complexity lossless compression method for encoding asynchronous event sequences that are suitable for hardware implementation into low-power chips.

AB The ATLAS experiment observes proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC accelerator at CERN. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects interesting events on-line in a three-level trigger system in order to store them at a budgeted rate of several hundred Hz, for an average event size of similar to 1.5 MB. This paper focuses on the TDAQ data-logging system and in particular on the implementation and performance of a novel software design, reporting on the effort of exploiting the full power of multi-core hardware. In this respect, the main challenge presented by the data-logging workload is the conflict between the largely parallel nature of the event processing, including the recently introduced on-line event-compression, and the constraint of sequential file writing and checksum evaluation. This is further complicated by the necessity of operating in a fully data-driven mode, to cope with continuously evolving trigger and detector configurations. In this paper we will briefly discuss our development experience using recent concurrency-oriented libraries. We will then concentrate on the results of performance measurements performed on the current data-logging hardware. We will show that, even in the worst workload, the new parallel design is able to compete with the previous single-threaded one, while it is outperforming it in more favourable, realistic workloads. We will as well demonstrate the minimal overhead introduced by the above parallel techniques, considering the whole data-logging software performances with respect to the bare processing speed on the same hardware. Finally, we will discuss the effects of simultaneous multi-threading technologies, as found on recent CPUs. The data-logging operation in fact, mixing data processing and I/O, allows to efficiently exploit the features provided by these technologies.

AB Today enterprises have massive stream data that require to be processed in real time due to data explosion in recent years. Spark Streaming as an emerging system is developed to process real time stream data analytics by using micro-batch approach. The unified programming model of Spark Steaming leads to some unique benefits over other traditional streaming systems, such as fast recovery from failures, better load balancing and resource usage. It treats the continuous stream as a series of micro-batches of data and continuously process these micro-batch jobs. However, efficient scheduling of micro-batch jobs to achieve high throughput and low latency is very challenging due to the complex data dependency and dynamism inherent in streaming workloads. In this paper, we propose A-scheduler, an adaptive scheduling approach that dynamically schedules parallel micro-batch jobs in Spark Streaming and automatically adjusts scheduling parameters to improve performance and resource efficiency. Specifically, A-scheduler dynamically schedules multiple jobs concurrently using different policies based on their data dependencies and automatically adjusts the level of job parallelism and resource shares among jobs based on workload properties. Furthermore, we integrate dynamic batching technique with A-Scheduler to further improve the overall performance of the customized Spark Streaming system. It relies on an expert fuzzy control mechanism to dynamically adjust the length of each batch interval in response to time-varying streaming workload and system processing rate. We implemented A-scheduler and evaluated it with a real-time security event processing workload. Our experimental results show that A-scheduler with dynamic batching can reduce end-to-end latency by 38 percent and meanwhile improve workload throughput and energy efficiency by 23 and 15 percent, respectively, compared to the default Spark Streaming scheduler.

In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques.

AB Following social events, individuals with social phobia engage in post-event processing (PEP), namely a post-mortem detailed analysis of a social situation. This study aimed to examine cognitive and symptom correlates of PEP, as well as stability of PEP, in the context of videotaped exposures that occurred during treatment at sessions four and eight. Before treatment, 75 individuals with DSM-IV diagnosed social phobia completed measures of social anxiety, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events. They rated their peak anxiety during the taped exposure. Then, they completed a measure of PEP one week after each videotaped exposure exercise. Results revealed that baseline social anxiety symptoms, state anxiety during the videotaping, anxious rumination, fear of causing discomfort to others, and negative interpretation of positive social events were all positively associated with PEP for the first taped exposure. Regression analyses demonstrated that unique predictors of PEP over and above baseline social anxiety were state social anxiety during the exposure, and anxious coping-focused rumination. This was largely replicated in the second taped exposure. In addition, PEP following two videotaped exposures separated by four weeks showed a moderate-to-large positive correlation. These findings highlight symptom and cognitive correlates of PEP, and underscore importance of state anxiety in social situations, as well as general anxiety focused rumination in social phobia.

AB Cognitive agents are typically utilized in autonomous systems for automated decision making. These systems interact at real time with their environment and are generally heavily power constrained. Thus there is a strong need for a real time agent running on a low power computing platform. This paper examines how some of the components of a cognitive agent can be mapped onto the IBM TrueNorth neurosynaptic system to achieve real time performance at low power. The agent examined is the Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture. This is an autonomous decision support tool that reasons like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision-making. It has applications in a large variety of domains including autonomous systems, operations research, intelligence analysis, and data mining. One of the most time consuming and key components of CECEP is the mining of knowledge from a repository described as a Cognitive Domain Ontology (CDO). This paper looks at how CDOs can be mapped into neural form for realtime applications, and then examines their implementation on the IBM TrueNorth processor. The results show that the TrueNorth implementation generated correct answers for all the CDOs examined.

AB Network security schemes generally deploy sensors and other network devices which generate huge volumes of data, overwhelming the underlying decision making algorithms. An example is corporate networks employing intrusion detection systems where there is a deluge of alert data, confounding the computations involved in sensor information fusion and alert correlation. One way to obtain fast and real-time responses is to preprocess such data to manageable sizes. In this paper, we show that data deduplication using computationally efficient fingerprinting algorithms can provide real-time results. We present an algorithm which utilizes Rabin Fingerprinting/hashing scheme for the purpose of data de-duplication. We have implemented this algorithm on Intel Atom, which is a powerful, energy efficient embedded processor. Our study is intended to show that the relatively low performing embedded processors are capable of providing the needed computational support if they were to handle security functions in the field. When compared to the algorithmic performance on a high end system, viz. Intel Core 2 Duo processor, the positive results obtained make a case for using the Atom processor in networked applications employing mobile devices.

AB Distributed streaming dataflow systems have evolved into scalable and fault-tolerant production-grade systems. Their applicability has departed from the mere analysis of streaming windows and complex-event processing, and now includes cloud applications and machine learning inference. Although the advancements in the state management of streaming systems have contributed significantly to their maturity, the internal state of streaming operators has been so far hidden from external applications. However, that internal state can be seen as a materialized view that can be used for analytics, monitoring, and debugging.
   In this paper we argue that exposing the internal state of streaming systems to outside applications by making it queryable, opens the road for novel use cases. To this end, we introduce S-QUERY: an approach and reference architecture where the state of stream processors can be queried - either live or through snapshots, achieving different isolation levels. We show how this new capability can be implemented in an existing opensource stream processor, and how queryable state can affect the performance of such a system. Our experimental evaluation suggests that the snapshot configuration adds only up to 8ms latency in the 99.99th percentile and negligible increase in 0-90th percentiles.

DE Ecommerce; Complex event processing; Fault tolerance
AB Online transaction systems require a high level of consistency and availability for it to perform well for the end use. Though there are tools like google analytics, which are more towards click streams, but very less focus has been given on tracing the critical events happening in ecommerce space. Business like online commerce or e-commerce require excellent fault tolerant mechanism for improved customer retention and increase profitability. The online events which captures the user behavior helps to understand the end customers spending patterns on the given site. Capturing of user behavior will be essential for profiling the customers into different categories based upon which they can be given preference to complete an online-transaction in the event of a fault. There are various access violations occurring at multiple interaction levels exist in order to complete a successful transaction in the web application. The constant demands for increased performance from the end-users are the rationale behind such an implementation. This paper focuses on implementation of fault tolerance event transactions in online e-commerce solution actor based approach to ensure better the user experience in the case of any faults during an online e-commerce events or transactions.

AB Since the environment for businesses is becoming more competitive by the day, business organizations have to be more adaptive to environmental changes and are constantly in a process of optimization. Fundamental parts of these organizations are their business processes. Discovering and understanding the actual execution flow of the processes deployed in organizations is an important enabler for the management, analysis, and optimization of both, the processes and the business. This has become increasingly difficult since business processes are now often dynamically changing and may produce hundreds of events per second. The basis for this paper is the Constructs Competition Miner (CCM): A divide-and-conquer algorithm which discovers block-structured processes from event logs possibly consisting of exceptional behaviour. In this paper we propose a set of modifications for the CCM to enable dynamic business process discovery of a run-time process model from a stream of events. We describe the different modifications with a particular focus on the influence of individual events, i.e. ageing techniques. We furthermore investigate the behaviour and performance of the algorithm and the ageing techniques on event streams of dynamically changing processes.

AB Simulation is perhaps the most cost-effective tool to evaluate the operation of a system under design. A flexible, easy to extend, fully object-oriented, and multilayered simulator for interconnection networks can be a very useful tool for multicomputer designers and researchers. It is so desirable to attach newly designed components to the existing models and to exploit detailed results. This paper presents XMulator, an object-oriented listener-based simulation environment for evaluating multicomputer interconnection networks. The simulator involves a toolbox of various network topologies, routing algorithms, switching techniques, and flexible router models. This work introduces a simulator, using listener-based integration methodology, which has a great impact on extensibility of the system. Mixed-mode event processing improves the performance of the simulator. By decoupling individual parts of the code, XMulator enables independent code development and creates a flexible and extensible environment for different aspects of network design. This simulator uses XML format to define network topologies, input parameters, and outputs reports providing a high level of flexibility. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first simulator enabled to simulate any arbitrary interconnection topology under different working conditions including in the presence of faults.

AB Efficiently evaluating a large number of arbitrary Boolean expressions is needed in many applications such as advertising exchanges, complex event processing, and publish/subscribe systems. However, most solutions can support only conjunctive Boolean expression matching. The limited number of solutions that can directly work on arbitrary Boolean expressions present performance and flexibility limitations. Moreover, normalizing arbitrary Boolean expressions into conjunctive forms and then using existing methods for evaluating such expressions is not effective because of the potential exponential increase in the size of the expressions. Therefore, we propose the A-Tree data structure to efficiently index arbitrary Boolean expressions. A-Tree is a multirooted tree, in which predicates and subexpressions from different arbitrary Boolean expressions are aggregated and shared. A-Tree employs dynamic self-adjustment policies to adapt itself as the workload changes. Moreover, A-Tree adopts different event matching optimizations. Our comprehensive experiments show that A-Tree-based matching outperforms existing arbitrary Boolean expression matching algorithms in terms of memory use, matching time, and index construction time by up to 71%, 99% and 75%, respectively. Even on conjunctive expression workloads, A-Tree achieves a lower matching time than state-ofthe-art conjunctive expression matching algorithms.

AB The cognitively enhanced complex event processing (CECEP) architecture being developed at the US Air Force is an autonomous decision support tool that reasons and learns like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision making. It has applications in both military and civilian domains. One of the most computationally challenging aspects of CECEP is mining domain knowledge captured in cognitive domain ontologies (CDOs). Real-time agents require massively linked knowledge databases to be searched using a large set of constraints to generate intelligent decisions in run time. This study examines how to parallelize and accelerate the CDO knowledge mining algorithm by converting it into a constraint network that can be solved using a parallelized generate and test exhaustive depth first search algorithm. Our results show that 1 GPGPU can provide speed-ups of 100 times over a Xeon CPU core and almost 8 times over a Xeon Phi processor for the search algorithm.

AB The GALEX instrument consists of a 50 cm normal incidence mirror telescope in combination with a grism, and a dichroic beamsplitter system projecting images onto two detectors simultaneously. The objective of this instrument is to provide sensitive high resolution imaging (3 to 5 arc ") of galaxies in two bandpasses (1350 - 1800 Angstrom and 1800 - 3000 Angstrom), with the option of modest (lambda/6 lambda 100 - 200) resolution spectroscopy. We are currently developing the microchannel plate, delay line, sealed tube detectors for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer(1) (GALEX) mission to be launched in 2001. The specifications for the two detector systems for GALEX require a large 65mm circular format, with high spatial resolution (<30 mu m FWHM, similar to 2200 x 2200 resolution elements) and good linearity (+/-50 mu m), <1 event cm(-2) sec(-1) background and counting rates of 1.25 x 10(5) events sec(-1). One detector covers the 1350 Angstrom to 1800 Angstrom region with an opaque CsI photocathode, and the other uses a semitransparent CsTe photocathode covering 1800 Angstrom to 3000 Angstrom. We are implementing these detectors using a microchannel plate Z stack to amplify the signals detected by the photocathodes, and a cross delay line anode to provide the photon event positions. Also part of this system are high speed event processing electronics, low and high voltage power supplies, and a command and house-keeping interface. We are currently testing unsealed flight like detectors to verify the component performance prior to integration and processing of the sealed tube assemblies. The microchannel plates (10 mu m & 12.5 mu m pores, 80:1 L/D) have a 75mm format and provide gain greater than or equal to 2 x 10(7) with pulse height distributions as low as <30% and low background (<0.4 event cm(-2)sec(-1)). Cathode tests have achieved 50% QDE at 1152 Angstrom for CsI and 18% at 1800 Angstrom for CsTe. The cross delay line readouts have achieved = 30 mu m FWHM resolution at 2 x 10(7) with good image linearity (<+/-50 mu m) and the flat field images are dominated by the microchannel plate multifiber boundary fixed pattern noise.

AB Background Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) often report a fear that they will lose control of their emotions or report intense, unpleasant thoughts or images of uncontrollably humiliating themselves in social situations. These fears and associated beliefs that one is likely to lose control may underlie the anxiety and/or cognitive biases (e.g., self-focused attention and negative post-event processing) experienced during and following social situations. The present experiment examined whether manipulating beliefs about losing control would cause changes in symptoms of SAD. Methods One hundred and twenty-six undergraduate psychology students were given false feedback that they were either at high or low risk of losing control, and then completed a social interaction task with an actor. Participants rated their anxiety before and during the interaction and completed a post-event processing questionnaire 24-hours later. Results Participants in the high beliefs about losing control (HLC) condition reported significantly greater subjective anxiety than those in the low beliefs about losing control (LLC) condition leading up to the social interaction task, and significantly more negative post-event processing. Conclusion Results suggest beliefs about losing control may play a causal role in the development and maintenance of SAD. These beliefs may represent a novel domain to be targeted in CBT.

AB With the wide integration of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and Internet of things (IoT), the manufacturing industry has entered into an era of big data. Thus, manufacturing companies are facing challenges when conducting Big Data Analytics, including the high velocity of data generation, the enormous volume, the multifarious formats and types as well as the quality or fidelity. In this paper, a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) using data analytics is proposed to enable production visibility. Firstly, this study uses data stream processing approaches to clean redundant data efficiently. Secondly, a Bayesian inference engine, which is trained by ming the historical data offline, is employed to identify the accuracy of an RFID-captured event online. Then, complex event processing is applied to fuse multi-source heterogeneous data. Finally, production progress visibility is achieved by the Business Process Management. The proposed system demonstrates that it is significant to implement real-time data collection, processing and visibility, as well as to improve production efficiency. A demonstrative case from the machinery industry is presented to validate the CPPS.

TI JetStream: Enabling high throughput live event streaming on multi-site
   clouds
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
DT Article
DE Cloud computing; Big Data; Multi-site; Stream processing
AB Scientific and commercial applications operate nowadays on tens of cloud datacenters around the globe, following similar patterns: they aggregate monitoring or sensor data, assess the QoS or run global data mining queries based on inter-site event stream processing. Enabling fast data transfers across geographically distributed sites allows such applications to manage the continuous streams of events in real time and quickly react to changes. However, traditional event processing engines often consider data resources as second-class citizens and support access to data only as a side-effect of computation (i.e. they are not concerned by the transfer of events from their source to the processing site): This is an efficient approach as long as the processing is executed in a single cluster where nodes are interconnected by low latency networks. In a distributed environment, consisting of multiple datacenters, with orders of magnitude differences in capabilities and connected by a WAN, this will undoubtedly lead to significant latency and performance variations. This is namely the challenge we address in this paper, by proposing JetStream, a high performance batch-based streaming middleware for efficient transfers of events between cloud datacenters. JetStream is able to self-adapt to the streaming conditions by modeling and monitoring a set of context parameters. It further aggregates the available bandwidth by enabling multi-route streaming across cloud sites, while at the same time optimizing resource utilization and increasing cost efficiency. The prototype was validated on tens of nodes from US and Europe datacenters of the Windows Azure cloud with synthetic benchmarks and a real-life application monitoring the ALICE experiment at CERN. The results show a 3 x increase of the transfer rate using the adaptive multi-route streaming, compared to state of the art solutions. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deep learning inference that needs to largely take place on the "edge" is a highly computational and memory inten-sive workload, making it intractable for low-power, embedded platforms such as mobile nodes and remote security applications. To address this challenge, this article proposes a real-time, hybrid neuromorphic framework for object tracking and classification using event-based cameras that possess desirable properties such as low-power consumption (5-14 mW) and high dynamic range (120 dB). Nonetheless, unlike traditional approaches of using event-by-event processing, this work uses a mixed frame and event approach to get energy savings with high performance. Using a frame-based region proposal method based on the density of foreground events, a hardware-friendly object tracking scheme is implemented using the apparent object velocity while tackling occlusion scenarios. The frame-based object track input is converted back to spikes for TrueNorth (TN) classification via the energy-efficient deep network (EEDN) pipeline. Using originally collected datasets, we train the TN model on the hardware track outputs, instead of using ground truth object locations as commonly done, and demonstrate the ability of our system to handle practical surveillance scenarios. As an alternative tracker paradigm, we also propose a continuous-time tracker with C++ implementation where each event is processed individually, which better exploits the low latency and asynchronous nature of neuromorphic vision sensors. Subse-quently, we extensively compare the proposed methodologies to state-of-the-art event-based and frame-based methods for object tracking and classification, and demonstrate the use case of our neuromorphic approach for real-time and embedded applications without sacrificing performance. Finally, we also showcase the efficacy of the proposed neuromorphic system to a standard RGB camera setup when simultaneously evaluated over several hours of traffic recordings.

AB This paper provides an overview of the SPEEDES persistence framework that is currently used to automate checkpoint/restart for the Joint Simulation System. The persistence framework interfaces are documented in this paper and are proposed standards for the Standard Simulation Architecture.
   The persistence framework fundamentally keeps track of memory allocations and pointer references within a high-speed internal database linked with applications. With persistence, an object, and the collection of objects it recursively references through pointers, can be automatically packed into a buffer that is written to disk or sent as a message to another machine. Later, that buffer can be used to reconstruct the object and all of its recursively referenced objects. The reconstructed objects will likely be instantiated at different memory locations. The persistence framework automatically updates all affected pointer references to account for this fact.
   The persistence framework is fully integrated with the SPEEDES rollback infrastructure and built-in container class libraries that include an implementation of the Standard Template Library. These utilities automate support for optimistic event processing required by many high-performance parallel and distributed time management algorithms. In the future, persistence will enable dynamic load balancing algorithms to migrate complex objects to different processors.

AB Tackling bottleneck and privacy issues of cloud computing, we attempt to push event stream processing down to devices which are currently empowered to compute and communicate at the edge of the networks. To accomplish that, we propose a self-organized task distribution framework that is composed of multiple brokers collaborating through our module-based event stream processing engine called EdgeCEP. Our system request is event-dependent specified in a brand-new event specification language; still, the event is stored and processed by the relational database. We newly formulate the problem of self-organized task distribution subjective to preferable constraints of computation and communication. The solution for each broker to find individual optimal decision is to apply tabu search with flow-based greedy move regarding pre-ranking flow table. Many experiments are conducted to study and evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The simulation shows that the proposed flow optimization outperforms the naive algorithm, concretely, 2-times more tasks getting processed and successfully delivered within the same fixed period. The proposed edge-centric method achieves data traffic 7-times less than the cloud-centric approach. The prototype engines have been deployed and evaluated in the real environment.

   The architecture proposed here is applicable to the management of complex systems, for example, manufacturing, healthcare, automobiles, and airplanes.
   The processing of information in real-time (through the processing of complex events) has become an essential task for the optimal functioning of manufacturing plants. Only in this way can artificial intelligence, data extraction, and even business intelligence techniques be applied, and the data produced daily be used in a beneficent way, enhancing automation processes and improving service delivery. Therefore, professionals and researchers need a wide range of tools to extract, transform, and load data in real-time efficiently. Additionally, the same tool supports or at least facilitates the visualization of this data intuitively and interactively. The review presented in this document aims to provide an up-to-date review of the various tools available to perform these tasks. Of the selected tools, a brief description of how they work, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their use, will be presented. Furthermore, a critical analysis of overall operation and performance will be presented. Finally, a hybrid architecture that aims to synergize all tools and technologies is presented and discussed.

AB The concept of complex event processing refers to the process of tracking and analyzing a set of related events and drawing conclusions from them. For such systems, complex event recognition is essential. The object of complex event recognition is to recognize meaningful events or patterns and construct processing rules to respond to them. Researchers have conducted numerous studies on the recognition of complex event patterns by using recognition languages or models. However, the completeness of the process in complex event recognition has rarely been discussed. Although the reality of the event is uncertain, the structure for modeling and explaining complex event interactions of contingent information remains unclear. In this study, we focused on developing a general framework for addressing these problems and demonstrating the applicability of model-based approaches to represent spatio-temporal dimensions and causality in complex event recognition. In this paper, we propose an event behavior model for complex event recognition from a process perspective. The developed model could detect and explain anomalies associated with complex events. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the model performance. The results revealed that temporal operations within overlapping events were crucial to event pattern recognition.

AB The ability of learning analytics to improve the learning/teaching processes is widely recognized. In this paper, the learning analytics architecture developed at the Digital Content Production Center of the Technical University of Cartagena (Spain) is presented. This architecture contributes to the field of learning analytics in two aspects: it allows for dashboard customization and improves the efficiency of the analysis of learners interaction data. Events resulting from learners interaction are captured and stored in Caliper standard format, to be further processed incrementally to allow dashboards to be shown without delay to teachers. Customization is considered a mandatory requirement for learning analytics tools, however, although some proposals have recently been made, a greater research effort in this topic is necessary. In the present work, this requirement is addressed by defining a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows teachers to customize dashboards. This language allows to express indicators (logical expressions) that classify students into different groups depending on their performance level. The paper also shows how our learning analytics approach was evaluated with a course that applies a flipped classroom method, and how it compares to the most relevant related works that have been published.

AB The perception of everyday events implies the segmentation into discrete sub-events (i.e. event segmentation). This process is relevant for the prediction of upcoming events and for the recall of recent activities. It is thought to involve dopaminergic networks which are strongly compromised in Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, deficits of event segmentation have been previously shown in PD, but underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. We therefore investigated 22 persons with PD and 22 age-matched healthy controls, who performed an event segmentation task with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). Both groups had to indicate by button press the beginning of sub-events within three movies showing persons performing everyday activities. The segmentation performance of persons with PD deviated significantly from that of controls. Neurophysiologically, persons with PD expressed reduced theta (4-7 Hz) activity around identified event boundaries compared to healthy controls. Together, these results point to disturbed event processing in PD. According to functions attributed to EEG activities in particular frequency ranges, the PD-related theta reduction could reflect impaired matching of perceptual input with stored event representations and decreased updating processes of event information in working memory and, thus, event boundary identification.

AB Predictive analytics are concerned as a type of complex event processing where a complex event can be predicted by utilizing insights extracted from a set of related events. This paper introduces a new complex event analysis for traffic risk prediction using 3D-CNN and a set of related events detected from multi-sources urban sensing data (e.g., congestion, traffic accident, precipitation). The contribution of this paper involves (1) the spatio-temporal information of multi-sources urban sensing data is reserved and wrapped into 3D raster images towards being able to leverage recent developments of 3D-CNN to conduct predictive analytics, (2) the imbalanced data problem which could severely affect the performance of deep learning models is tackled by straightening curved geographic chains, (3) traffic risks can be predicted well in both short-term and medium-term time horizons, and (4) The influence of related events detected from extra factors on a complex event can be explained explicitly. The proposed method is evaluated on the real dataset collected in Kobe, Japan during 2014 and 2015. The comparisons to baseline methods such as historical average and 2D-CNN show the advantage of the proposed method as well.

AB Real-time emergency event processing for mega-constellation management requires an approach that can quickly obtain a satisfactory satellite range rescheduling scheme. In this article, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed for rapid rescheduling on the basis of established satellite range scheduling schemes. Three rescheduling principles with different impacts on established scheduling schemes are first analyzed. A mathematical model for both maximizing the completion profits of dynamic missions and minimizing their impacts on scheduled missions is formulated. An efficient DRL-based approach to satellite range rescheduling is then developed. A mask processing mechanism is integrated into the reinforcement learning framework to effectively eliminate the conflicts accurately expressed by the conflict space, and a modified pointer network (Ptr-Net) based on the mask processing mechanism is employed to approximate the action-value function for optimal decision-making. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the rule-based heuristic and another DRL-based method in terms of computational efficiency and optimization performance, and the total time spent during the training and testing phases of the proposed approach is approximately 13% of the total running time required by the search-based methods.

AB Models of social anxiety emphasize anticipatory processing (AP) and post-event processing (PEP) as repetitive negative thinking (RNT) processes that occur before and after social-evaluative events, respectively. Both AP and PEP have been implicated as maladaptive processes which maintain social anxiety. Accordingly, a common vulnerability, such as poor attentional control, may serve to maintain both. The present research included two separate samples to investigate the relationship between attentional control and AP (Sample 1) and PEP (Sample 2). Participants (n = 49 for Sample 1; n = 35 for Sample 2) completed self-report measures of social anxiety, AP or PEP, attentional control, and trait anxiety. Poorer total attentional control was associated with social anxiety in both samples. In addition, attentional control total and attentional shifting were negatively associated with PEP (Sample 2) but not with AP (Sample 1). Mediation modeling suggested that trait anxiety mediated the relationship between total attentional control and PEP. The findings suggest that attentional control plays a role in the regulation of emotion, such as anxiety, and RNT processes, such as PEP, but not AP.

AB Background and objectives: Negative post-event processing (PEP) is a key maintenance factor of social anxiety, but little is known about the role positive PEP, particularly in relation to situations that are not perceived as stressful. The objective was to examine negative and positive PEP following stressful and pleasant social interactions. We were also interested in how participants remembered and described the interactions. Methods: Young adults (n = 411) recalled a recent pleasant or stressful social interaction and indicated how much negative and positive PEP they engaged in since the interaction. They also completed questionnaires measuring social anxiety and the memory's phenomenological qualities and wrote a description of the interaction. Results: Higher social anxiety was linked with more negative and less positive PEP, regardless of whether the interaction was perceived as stressful or pleasant. Participants reporting more negative PEP used more negative words in describing the interaction and their memory was more negative and emotionally intense. Those reporting more positive PEP used more positive and less negative words in their descriptions. For stressful interactions, positive PEP was related to a more positive memory; for pleasant ones, it was related to increased emotional intensity. Limitations: Limitations included the sample type (restricted age range, non-clinical) and the retrospective, crosssectional nature of the study. Conclusions: Results provide insight into PEP following stressful and pleasant social interactions. We also found preliminary evidence that positive PEP may be helpful and protective. Future studies may benefit from longitudinal and mixed methods designs.

TI Post-Event Processing across Multiple Anxiety Presentations: Is it
   Specific to Social Anxiety Disorder?

AB Background: Post-event processing (PEP) occurs when individuals engage in cognitive rumination following an event or interaction. Although the relation between PEP and social anxiety has been clearly demonstrated, it remains unclear whether PEP is limited to individuals with elevated social anxiety, or if it is also problematic among people with other anxiety presentations. Aims: The present study assessed PEP after the first session of group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in individuals with a variety of anxiety presentations. Method: Participants with a principal diagnosis of SAD (N = 25), those diagnosed with a principal other anxiety disorder with comorbid SAD (N = 18), and those with principal other anxiety diagnoses with no SAD (N = 43) completed baseline measures of social anxiety severity and state anxiety at their first session of CBT and measures of PEP one week later. Results: Participants with a principal diagnosis of SAD experienced the most PEP in the week following the first CBT session, while those with no comorbid SAD experienced the least. Those with comorbid SAD experienced intermediate levels of PEP. The strongest predictor of PEP was state anxiety during the first session. Conclusions: Results suggest that PEP is more problematic for clients with SAD as part of their clinical presentation. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB Detection and diagnosis of the plant diseases in the early stage significantly minimize yield losses. Image-based automated plant diseases identification (APDI) tools have started to been widely used in pest managements strategies. The current APDI systems rely on images captured in laboratory conditions, which hardens the usage of the APDI systems by smallholder farmers. In this study, we investigate whether the smallholder farmers can exploit APDI systems using their basic and cheap unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) with standard cameras. To create the tomato images like the one taken by UAVs, we build a new dataset from a public dataset by using image processing tools. The dataset includes tomato leaf photographs separated into 10 classes (diseases or healthy). To detect the diseases, we develop a new hybrid detection model, called SpikingTomaNet, which merges a novel deep convolutional neural network model with spiking neural network (SNN) model. This hybrid model provides both better accuracy rates for the plant diseases identification and more energy efficiency for the battery-constrained UAVs due to the SNN's event-driven architecture. In this hybrid model, the features extracted from the CNN model are used as the input layer for SNNs. To assess our approach's performance, firstly, we compare the proposed CNN model inside the developed hybrid model with well-known AlexNet, VggNet-5 and LeNet models. Secondly, we compare the developed hybrid model with three hybrid models composed of combinations of the well-known models and SNN model. To train and test the proposed neural network, 32022 images in the dataset are exploited. The results show that the SNN method significantly increases the success, especially in the augmented dataset. The experiment result shows that while the proposed hybrid model provides 97.78% accuracy on original images, its success on the created datasets is between 59.97%-82.98%. In addition, the results shows that the proposed hybrid model provides better overall accuracy in the classification of the diseases in comparison to the well-known models and LeNet and their combination with SNN.

AB Clinical researchers suggest that post-event thinking functions to negatively bias event recall for socially anxious participants. We used a repeated retrieval paradigm to examine the effects of post-event retrieval on memory for social information. Undergraduate participants (n = 214) engaged in an impromptu public speaking task and received a standardised mixture of positive and negative feedback on their speech. Participants in the experimental condition were instructed to repeatedly retrieve the negative feedback items whereas participants in the control condition completed a control task. Both groups were asked to recall the feedback after five minutes and after one week. Results indicated that the experimental group displayed the hypothesised retrieval-induced forgetting effect. In addition, repeated retrieval predicted valence change in that participants recalled the non-retrieved positive feedback items less positively over time. The retrieval-practice effects were distinct from self-reported post-event processing. Contrary to clinical theories, social anxiety did not moderate retrieval-induced forgetting or recall bias. Instead, all participants displayed retrieval-related negatively biased recall.

The ATLAS Trigger system consists of two levels, the first level (L1) implemented in hardware and the High Level Trigger (HLT) implemented in software running on a computing cluster of commodity CPUs. The HLT reduces the trigger rate from the 100 kHz L1 accept rate to 1 kHz for recording, requiring an average per-event processing time of similar to 300 ms for this task. The HLT selection is based on reconstructing tracks in the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer and clusters of energy deposited in the calorimeters (electromagnetic and hadronic). Performing this reconstruction within the available HLT computing cluster resources presents a significant challenge. Future HLT upgrades will result in higher detector occupancies and, consequently, will harden the reconstruction constraints. General purpose Graphics Processor Units (GPGPU) are being evaluated for possible future inclusion in an upgraded HLT computing cluster. We report on a demonstrator that has been developed consisting of GPGPU implementations of the calorimeters clustering and Inner Detector and Muon tracking algorithms integrated within the HLT software framework. We give a brief overview of the algorithm implementation and present preliminary measurements comparing the performance of the GPGPU algorithms with the current CPU versions.

TI High accuracy concurrent event processing in hard real-time systems
SO REAL-TIME SYSTEMS
DT Article
AB A computer organisation suitable to improve the performance of embedded systems encountered in hard real-time environments is described, which enhances dependability and efficiency by exploiting possibilities for parallel processing inherent to real-time systems. It is shown that internal data transmissions due to context-switching can be eliminated and that CPUs can be relieved from a considerable amount of routine work by providing a separate module for major functions of real-time operating systems, viz., for interrupt and signal recognition, for time management, and for the administration of task execution plans and states. Considering the layer model of contemporary real-time operating systems, these functions constitute kernel and first layer. The hardware implementation of typical hard real-time support features provides a clear physical separation of the intrinsically independent functions event reaction and (user) task processing. While minimising response times in general, the architecture enables to guarantee predefined, short upper bounds for them. It also incorporates a new approach for and hardware realisation of timers characterised by utmost precision and high handling comfort. Such timers are particularly well-suited to serve in distributed real-time systems, since, by employing the exact UTC received from the satellites of GPS (the global navigation and positioning system), synchronisation is not needed anymore.

DE Browser; JavaScript; Real-Time System; Pre-emption
AB For billions of deployed browsers, JavaScript provides the platform-independent lingua franca that enabled the triumphal march of web-based applications. Originally intended for simple UI-event processing, JavaScript comes with an event-driven programming model, where event-callback functions are executed in strict sequential order. However, with applications getting more complex and tasks becoming more computation intensive, its first-come-first-served and run-to-completion semantic is hitting a limit, when reactions to user inputs are delayed beyond the human perception threshold. With the rise of the Internet of Things, this leads to friction-filled user experiences in everyday situations.
   With RT.js, we selectively introduce pseudo-preemption points into JavaScript functions and sequence the execution of event callbacks with well-known real-time scheduling policies, like EDF. Thereby, we provide a soft real-time abstraction that mitigates the described shortcomings of the JavaScript execution model without modifying the actual engine; making RT.js compatible with billions of devices. Applied to generated real-time task sets, we can almost eliminate the 30-percent deadline-miss ratios of baseline JavaScript at moderate costs. In a browser-based macro benchmark, we could diminish the influence of computation-intensive background tasks on the page-rendering performance.

DE Event Camera; Pose Tracking; LED Marker Points
AB Using of vision sensors to achieve pose tracking has become a hot spot currently in the domain of computer vision. traditional vision sensors. However, the frame output of the conventional vision sensor and the redundant image data have a large delay and are highly dependent on the light intensity. There is a need for an attitude tracking technique that relies less on light and has a lower latency to improve system performance. Compared with traditional vision sensors, a new type of event camera is inspired by the neural network principle to develop event-based vision sensing technology, which is more robust in terms of delay and dependence on light intensity. We applied event processing algorithms to high-frequency flashing LED markers, including frequency filtering, clustering, and feature-point tracking. In the pose tracking of the event camera, the attitude is obtained from the PnP (perspective-n-point) algorithm, and a least-squares method is used to optimize the pose tracking. The experiment uses high-frequency LED as marking points, showing the comparison of event camera output in high and low light intensity environments, stability testing of frequency filtering clustering algorithm, and Z-axis data error of pose tracking within 5%. This method can be applied to attitude tracking in low light intensity environments.

DE data acquisition; multiprocessor interconnection; triggering
AB At the upcoming new Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research FAIR at GSI the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment CBM requires a new architecture of front-end electronics, data acquisition, and event processing. The detector systems of CBM are a Silicon Tracker System (STS), RICH detectors, a TRD, RPCs, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. The envisioned interaction rate of 10 MHz will produce a data rate of up to 1 TByte/s. Because of the complexity and variability of trigger decisions no common trigger will be applied. Instead, the front-end electronics of all detectors will be self-triggered and marked by time stamps. The full data rate must be switched through a high speed network fabric into a computational network,with configurable processing resources for event building and filtering. The decision for selecting candidate events requires tracking, primary vertex reconstruction, and secondary vertex finding in the STS at the full interaction rate. The essential performance factor is now computational throughput rather than decision latency, which results in a much better utilization of the processing resources especially in the case of heavy ion collisions with strongly varying multiplicities. The development of key components is supported by the FutureDAQ project of the European Union (FP6 13HP JRA1).

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS
DT Article
DE Algorithms; Security; Data integrity; data streams; query authentication
ID PROOFS
AB We consider a stream outsourcing setting, where a data owner delegates the management of a set of disjoint data streams to an untrusted server. The owner authenticates his streams via signatures. The server processes continuous queries on the union of the streams for clients trusted by the owner. Along with the results, the server sends proofs of result correctness derived from the owner's signatures, which are verifiable by the clients. We design novel constructions for a collection of fundamental problems over streams represented as linear algebraic queries. In particular, our basic schemes authenticate dynamic vector sums, matrix products, and dot products. These techniques can be adapted for authenticating a wide range of important operations in streaming environments, including group-by queries, joins, in-network aggregation, similarity matching, and event processing. We also present extensions to address the case of sliding window queries, and when multiple clients are interested in different subsets of the data. These methods take advantage of a novel nonce chaining technique that we introduce, which is used to reduce the verification cost without affecting any other costs. All our schemes are lightweight and offer strong cryptographic guarantees derived from formal definitions and proofs. We experimentally confirm the practicality of our schemes in the performance-sensitive streaming setting.

AB Network operators are increasingly using analytic applications to improve the performance of their networks. Telecommunications analytical applications typically use SQL and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for data processing, network analysis and troubleshooting. Such approaches are hindered as they require an in-depth knowledge of both the telecommunications domain and telecommunications data structures in order to create the required queries. Valuable information contained in free form text data fields such as "additional_info", "user_text" or "problem_text" can also be ignored. This work proposes An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting (ADAMANT), a text analytic based network anomaly detection approach. Once telecommunications data records have been indexed, ADAMANT uses distance based outlier detection within sliding windows to detect abnormal terms at configurable time intervals. Traditional approaches focus on a specific type of record and create specific cause and effect rules. With the ADAMANT approach all free form text fields of alarms, logs, etc. are treated as text documents similar to twitter feeds. All documents within a window represent a snapshot of the network state that is processed by ADAMANT. The ADAMANT approach focuses on text analytics to provide automated analysis without the requirement for SQL/CEP queries. Such an approach provides distinct network insights in comparison to traditional approaches.

AB Research on event-based processing and analysis of media is receiving an increasing attention from the scientific community due to its relevance for an abundance of applications, from consumer video management and video surveillance to lifelogging and social media. Events have the ability to semantically encode relationships of different informational modalities, such as visual-audio-text, time, involved agents and objects, with the spatio-temporal component of events being a key feature for contextual analysis. This unveils an enormous potential for exploiting new information sources and opening new research directions. In this paper, we survey the existing literature in this field. We extensively review the employed conceptualization of the notion of event in multimedia, the techniques for event representation and modeling, the feature representation and event inference approaches for the problems of event detection in audio, visual, and textual content. Furthermore, we review some key event-based multimedia applications, and various benchmarking activities that provide solid frameworks for measuring the performance of different event processing and analysis systems. We provide an in-depth discussion of the insights obtained from reviewing the literature and identify future directions and challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture is an autonomous decision support tool that reasons and learns like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision making. This architecture has applications in both military and civilian domains, including operations research and data mining. One of the most computationally challenging aspects of CECEP is mining domain knowledge captured in cognitive domain ontologies (CDOs). This requires massively linked knowledge databases to be searched based on a large set of constraints to generate intelligent decisions. The solution search for CDOs is a kind of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Due to the unique nature of the CDO-to-CSP mapping, generic constraint solvers are inefficient. We introduce a novel high performance path based forward checking CSP algorithm to solve CDOs and compare it to a commonly utilized CSP solving application. Additionally our approach enables a very compact and efficient representation of the entire solution space to allow fast processing and give agents key ideas on how to further reduce the solution space. The proposed algorithm provided a speedup of about 10-25 times for generating the first solution and about half a million times for all the solutions over a Choco based conventional CSP approach.

AB PurposeExcessive attentional allocation towards threats has been theorized to play a maintaining role in social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, it is unclear if both heightened attentional focus towards internal threats (i.e., interoceptive signals of anxiety) and external threats (i.e., negative social-evaluative cues) are pathogenic. Further, evidence for the causal pathways by which biased attention maintains SAD is limited. The present study tested the effects of experimentally induced internally and externally oriented attention towards threats relative to a neutral control on state anxiety and post-event processing (PEP) in a highly socially anxious sample.MethodsDuring an impromptu speech task, participants (N = 123) were randomized to allocating their attention to their own thoughts, actions, or body sensations (internal condition; n = 41), to an audience member's reactions and evaluations (external condition; n = 42), or to a neutral object (control condition; n = 40). State anxiety and PEP were assessed immediately following the speech and 24 h later.ResultsAlthough no differences between the control condition and the external and internal conditions were observed, participants in the internal condition reported significantly higher state anxiety immediately after the speech and higher PEP 24 h later compared to the external condition. State anxiety immediately after the speech mediated heightened PEP 24 h later among the internal condition compared to the external condition.ConclusionsFindings support the theorized maladaptive role of self-focused attention in the maintenance of SAD and suggest that attending internally may be more harmful than attending externally, despite the presence of socio-evaluative threats in the environment.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Binaural Sound Source Localization (BSSL) is a remarkable topic in robot design and human hearing aid. A great number of algorithms flourished due to a leap in machine learning. However, prior approaches lack the ability to make a trade-off between parameter size and accuracy, which is a primary obstacle to their further implementation on resource-constrained devices. Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based models have also emerged due to their inherent computing superiority over sparse event processing. Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a classic Spiking Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) which has the natural potential of processing spatiotemporal information. LSM has been proved advantageous on numerous tasks once proposed. Yet, to our best knowledge, it is the first proposed BSSL model based on LSM, and we name it BSSL-LSM. BSSL-LSM is lightweight with only 1.04M parameters, which is a considerable reduction compared to CNN (10.1M) and D-BPNN (2.23M) while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy. Compared to SNN-IID, there is a 10% accuracy improvement for 10 degrees interval localization. To achieve better performance, we introduce Bayesian Optimization (BO) for hyperparameters searching and a novel soft label technique for better differentiating adjacent angles, which can be easily mirrored on related works.

TI Real-Time Context-Aware Microservice Architecture for Predictive
   Analytics and Smart Decision-Making
SO IEEE ACCESS

   architecture; decision making; microservice architecture
AB The impressive evolution of the Internet of Things and the great amount of data flowing through the systems provide us with an inspiring scenario for Big Data analytics and advantageous real-time context-aware predictions and smart decision-making. However, this requires a scalable system for constant streaming processing, also provided with the ability of decision-making and action taking based on the performed predictions. This paper aims at proposing a scalable architecture to provide real-time context-aware actions based on predictive streaming processing of data as an evolution of a previously provided event-driven service-oriented architecture which already permitted the context-aware detection and notification of relevant data. For this purpose, we have defined and implemented a microservice-based architecture which provides real-time context-aware actions based on predictive streaming processing of data. As a result, our architecture has been enhanced twofold: on the one hand, the architecture has been supplied with reliable predictions through the use of predictive analytics and complex event processing techniques, which permit the notification of relevant context-aware information ahead of time. On the other, it has been refactored towards a microservice architecture pattern, highly improving its maintenance and evolution. The architecture performance has been evaluated with an air quality case study.

AB The analysis of security-related event logs is an important step for the investigation of cyber-attacks. It allows tracing malicious activities and lets a security operator find out what has happened. However, since IT landscapes are growing in size and diversity, the amount of events and their highly different representations are becoming a Big Data challenge. Unfortunately, current solutions for the analysis of security-related events, so called Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, are not able to keep up with the load. In this work, we propose a distributed SIEM platform that makes use of highly efficient distributed normalization and persists event data into an in-memory database. We implement the normalization on common distribution frameworks, i.e. Spark, Storm, Trident and Heron, and compare their performance with our custom-built distribution solution. Additionally, different tuning options are introduced and their speed advantage is presented. In the end, we show how the writing into an in-memory database can be tuned to achieve optimal persistence speed. Using the proposed approach, we are able to not only fully normalize, but also persist more than 20 billion events per day with relatively small client hardware. Therefore, we are confident that our approach can handle the load of events in even very large IT landscapes.

AB Virtual prototyping of integrated mixed-signal smart-sensor systems requires high-performance co-simulation of analog frontend circuitry with complex digital controller hardware and embedded real-time software. We use SystemC/TLM 2.0 in combination with a cycle-count accurate temporal decoupling approach to simulate digital components and firmware code execution at high speed while preserving clock cycle accuracy and, thus, real-time behavior at time quantum boundaries. Optimal time quanta ensuring real-time capability can be calculated and set automatically during simulation if the simulation engine has access to exact timing information about upcoming communication events. These methods fail in case of non-deterministic, asynchronous events resulting in a possibly invalid simulation result. In this paper, we propose an extension of this method to the case of asynchronous events generated by blackbox sources from which a-priori event timing information is not available, such as coupled analog simulators or hardware in the loop. Additional event processing latency and/or rollback effort caused by temporal decoupling is minimized by calculating optimal time quanta dynamically in a SystemC model using a linear prediction scheme. For an example smart-sensor system model, we show that quasi-periodic events that trigger activities in temporally decoupled processes are handled accurately after the predictor has settled.

AB The Data Acquisition System of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider reads out event fragments of an average size of 2 kB from around 650 detector front-ends at a rate of up to 100 kHz. The first stage of event-building is performed by the Super-Fragment Builder employing custom-built electronics and a Myrinet optical network. It reduces the number of fragments by one order of magnitude, thereby greatly decreasing the requirements for the subsequent event-assembly stage. Back-pressure from the down-stream event-processing or variations in the size and rate of events may give rise to buffer overflows in the subdetector's front-end electronics, which would result in data corruption and would require a time-consuming re-sync procedure to recover. The Trigger-Throttling System protects against these buffer overflows. It provides fast feedback from any of the subdetector front-ends to the trigger so that the trigger can be throttled before buffers overflow. This paper reports on new performance measurements and on the recent successful integration of a scaled-down setup of the described system with the trigger and with front-ends of all major subdetectors. The on-going commissioning of the full-scale system is discussed.

AB BACKGROUND: Decision support systems (DSSs) are being developed to use events entered in anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) for quality of care, compliance, billing, documentation, and management purposes. DSS performance is impacted by latency from the actual time an event occurs to when it is written to the database, as well as how often the database is queried. Such latencies may result in poor DSS recommendations.
   METHODS: We analyzed approximately 48,000 cases at Hospital A for latency of two DSS prototype events, Beginh and Surgery End. Each latency was measured from 1) the time that the event was recorded in the AIMS database as having taken place to 2) the time when the first DSS query would have been executed after the documentation of that event by the provider. The effects on latency of 1, 5, and 10 min query intervals were determined. Latencies for Surgery Begin and Surgery End were compared with those of Hospital B, where a different AIMS was used.
   RESULTS: Network delays and the event processing time of the AIMS contributed <1 s and 30 s, respectively, to latency. Average latencies for the two studied events were approximately half of the query interval, the expected value if the events occurred randomly within each interval. However, the longest 5% of latencies exceeded the query interval. This was not due to providers editing the times of the Begin or End Surgery events, as each occurred in only 0.7%, of cases. Although the median latencies for the two events were longer at Hospital B than Hospital A by a few minutes, the 90th and 95th percentiles of the latencies were much longer at Hospital B (8-30 min, depending on the query interval and the percentile).
   CONCLUSIONS: DSS performance is influenced by the timeliness of documentation, the incidence of missing documentation and the query interval. Facilities using a DSS, including electronic whiteboards showing patient status, should assess the latencies of the measured events and critique the influence of the latencies on clinical and managerial decisions.

AB Introduction.-Previous researches have shown that anxiety symptoms are negatively associated with measures of intelligence. However, recent findings indicate possible positive relationships between Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD) and intelligence. Also, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with a moderate degree of underperformance on cognitive tests, including deficient processing. There are inconsistent results to present the relationship between Major Depression Disorder (MDD) and IQ. The present study has three main aims. The first aim of this study is to investigate the difference between IQ in individuals with GAD, OCD and major depressive disorder, and normal group. The second purpose is to perform a comparative study between the GAD, OCD and MDD groups on verbal and non-verbal intelligence. The third aim of this study is to examine the relationships between GAD, OCD and MDD as well as their underlying cognitive processes, including worry, rumination, and post-event processing, with verbal and non-verbal intelligence.
   Objective.-The present study is performed on four groups of participants including those with GAD, OCD, MDD and Healthy Volunteer (HV) group consisting of individuals without psychiatric disorders. Method.-The number of 50 healthy volunteers as the control group, 45 patients with GAD, 20 patients with OCD and 25 patients with MDD (n = 140) were selected as the case-referent groups. The present study was a cross-sectional type and the research was performed based on the causal-comparative method. Verbal and non-verbal intelligence was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition (WAIS-III). Rumination and post-event processing were measured by PSWQ, RRS-BR, and PEPQ, respectively. Results.-The results indicate that Verbal Intelligence and Verbal Comprehension Index in GAD patients have significant differences in comparison to the OCD, MDD and control groups. While, the value of the Working Memory Index (WMI) in the normal group is higher than the value of the same index in the GAD, OCD and MDD groups. Also, the values of the Processing Speed Index (PSI) in normal and GAD groups are higher than the OCD and MDD groups. The worry, rumination, and post-event processing in patients with GAD are positively correlated with general and verbal intelligence. But, verbal and non-verbal intelligence had a negative correlation with worry, rumination and post-event processing in healthy volunteers.
   Conclusion.-Investigation of the possible connections between intelligence and the cognitive processes underlying emotional disorders can provide therapeutic strategies for smart individuals who are at risk for GAD.

TI ALACA: A platform for dynamic alarm collection and alert notification in

AB Mobile network operators run Operations Support Systems that produce vast amounts of alarm events. These events can have different significance levels and domains and also can trigger other ones. Network operators face the challenge to identify the significance and root causes of these system problems in real time and to keep the number of remedial actions at an optimal level, so that customer satisfaction rates can be guaranteed at a reasonable cost. In this paper, we propose a scalable streaming alarm management system, referred to as Alarm Collector and Analyzer, that includes complex event processing and root cause analysis. We describe a rule mining and root cause analysis solution for alarm event correlation and analyses. The solution includes a dynamic index for matching active alarms, an algorithm for generating candidate alarm rules, a sliding window-based approach to save system resources, and a graph-based solution to identify root causes. Alarm Collector and Analyzer is used in the network operation center of a major mobile telecom provider. It helps operators to enhance the design of their alarm management systems by allowing continuous analysis of data and event streams and predict network behavior with respect to potential failures by using the results of root cause analysis. We present experimental results that provide insights on performance of real-time alarm data analytics systems.

AB Traditionally, mental health specialists monitor their patients' social behavior by applying subjective self-report questionnaires in face-to-face meetings. Usually, the application of the self-report questionnaire is limited by cognitive biases (e.g., memory bias and social desirability). As an alternative, we present a solution to detect context-aware sociability patterns and behavioral changes based on social situations inferred from ubiquitous device data. This solution does not focus on the diagnosis of mental states, but works on identifying situations of interest to specialized professionals. The proposed solution consists of an algorithm based on frequent pattern mining and complex event processing to detect periods of the day in which the individual usually socializes. Social routine recognition is performed under different context conditions to differentiate abnormal social behaviors from the variation of usual social habits. The proposed solution also can detect abnormal behavior and routine changes. This solution uses fuzzy logic to model the knowledge of the mental health specialist necessary to identify the occurrence of behavioral change. Evaluation results show that the prediction performance of the identified context-aware sociability patterns has strong positive relation (Pearson's correlation coefficient >70%) with individuals' social routine. Finally, the evaluation conducted recognized that the proposed solution leading to the identification of abnormal social behaviors and social routine changes consistently.

AB With the emergence of Docker, it becomes easier to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight Linux containers and make them available to the world by deploying them in the cloud. Compared to hypervisor-based virtualization approaches, the use of containers provides faster start-ups times and reduces the consumption of computer resources. However, Docker lacks of deployability verification tool for containers at design time. Currently, the only way to be sure that the designed containers will execute well is to test them in a running system. If errors occur, a correction is made but this operation can be repeated several times before the deployment becomes operational. Docker does not provide a solution to increase or decrease the size of container resources in demand. Besides the deployment of containers, Docker lacks of synchronization between the designed containers and those deployed. Moreover, container management with Docker is done at low level, and therefore requires users to focus on low level system issues. In this paper we focus on these issues related to the management of Docker containers. In particular, we propose an approach for modeling Docker containers. We provide tooling to ensure the deployability and the management of Docker containers. We illustrate our proposal using an event processing application and show how our solution provides a significantly better compromise between performance and development costs than the basic Docker container solution.

AB After the Long Shutdown 2 period, the upgraded ALICE detector at the LHC will produce more than a terabyte of data per second. The data, constituted from a continuous un-triggered stream data, have to be distributed from about 250 First Level Processor nodes (FLPs) to about 1500 Event Processing Nodes (EPNs). Each FLP receives a small subset of the detector data that is chopped in sub-time frames. One EPN needs all the fragments from the 250 FLPs to build a full time frame. An algorithm has been implemented on the FLPs with the aim of optimizing the usage of the network connecting the FLPs and EPNs. The algorithm minimizes contention when several FLPs are sending to the same EPN. An adequate traffic shaping is implemented by delaying the sending time of each FLP by a unique offset. The payloads are stored in a buffer large enough to accommodate the delay provoked by the maximum number of FLPs. As the buffers are queued for sending, the FLPs can operate with the highest efficiency. Using the time information embedded in the data any further FLP synchronization can be avoided. Moreover, zero-copy and multipart messages of ZeroMQ are used to create full time frames on the EPNs without the overhead of copying the payloads. The concept and the performance measurement of the implementation on a reference computing cluster are presented.

AB Today, many application areas require continuous processing of data streams in an efficient manner and real-time fashion. Processing these continuous flows of data, integrating dynamic data with other data sources, and providing the required semantics lead to real challenges. Thus, Linked Stream Data (LSD) has been proposed which combines two concepts: Linked Open Data and Data Stream Processing (DSP). Recently, several LSD engines have been developed, including C-SPARQL and CQELS, which are based on SPARQL extensions for continuous query processing. However, this SPARQL-centric view makes it difficult to express complex processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a LSD engine based on a more general stream processing approach. Instead of a variant of SPARQL, our engine provides a dataflow specification language called PipeFlow which is compiled into native code. PipeFlow supports native stream processing operators (e.g., window, aggregates, and joins), complex event processing as well as RDF data transformation operators such as tuplifier and triplifier to efficiently support LSD queries and provide a higher degree of expressiveness. We discuss the main concepts addressing the challenges of LSD processing and describe the usage of these concepts for processing queries from LSBench and SRBench. We show the effectiveness of our system in terms of query execution times through a comparison with existing systems as well as through a detailed performance analysis of our system implementation.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent the third generation of neural networks and are expected to enable new classes of machine learning applications. However, evaluating large-scale SNNs (e.g., of the scale of the visual cortex) on power-constrained systems requires significant improvements in computing efficiency. A unique attribute of SNNs is their event-driven nature-information is encoded as a series of spikes, and work is dynamically generated as spikes propagate through the network. Therefore, parallel implementations of SNNs on multi-cores and GPGPUs are severely limited by communication and synchronization overheads. Recent years have seen great interest in deep learning accelerators for non-spiking neural networks, however, these architectures are not well suited to the dynamic, irregular parallelism in SNNs. Prior efforts on specialized SNN hardware utilize spatial architectures, wherein each neuron is allocated a dedicated processing element, and large networks are realized by connecting multiple chips into a system. While suitable for large-scale systems, this approach is not a good match to size or cost constrained mobile devices.
   We propose PEASE, a Programmable Event-driven processor Architecture for SNN Evaluation. PEASE comprises of Spike Processing Units (SPUs) that are dynamically scheduled to execute computations triggered by a spike. Instructions to the SPUs are dynamically generated by Spike Schedulers (SSs) that utilize event queues to track unprocessed spikes and identify neurons that need to be evaluated. The memory hierarchy in PEASE is fully software managed, and the processing elements are interconnected using a two-tiered bus-ring topology matching the communication characteristics of SNNs. We propose a method to map any given SNN to PEASE such that the workload is balanced across SPUs and SPU clusters, while pipelining across layers of the network to improve performance. We implemented PEASE at the RTL level and synthesized it to IBM 45 technology. Across 6 SNN benchmarks, our 64-SPU configuration of PEASE achieves 7.1x-17.5x and 2.6x-5.8x speedups, respectively, over software implementations on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU and NVIDIA Tesla K40C GPU. The energy reductions over the CPU and GPU are 71x-179x and 198x-467x, respectively.

AB The ATLAS experiment is projected to collect over one billion events/year during the first few years of operation. The efficient selection of events for various physics analyses across all appropriate samples presents a significant technical challenge. ATLAS computing infrastructure leverages the Grid to tackle the analysis across large samples by organizing data into a hierarchical structure and exploiting distributed computing to churn through the computations. This includes events at different stages of processing: RAW, ESD (Event Summary Data), AOD (Analysis Object Data), DPD (Derived Physics Data). Event Level Metadata Tags (TAGs) contain information about each event stored using multiple technologies accessible by POOL and various web services. This allows users to apply selection cuts on quantities of interest across the entire sample to compile a subset of events that are appropriate for their analysis. This paper describes new methods for organizing jobs using the TAGs criteria to analyze ATLAS data. It further compares different access patterns to the event data and explores ways to partition the workload for event selection and analysis. Here analysis is defined as a broader set of event processing tasks including event selection and reduction operations ("skimming", "slimming" and "thinning") as well as DPD making. Specifically it compares analysis with direct access to the events (AOD and ESD data) to access mediated by different TAG-based event selections. We then compare different ways of splitting the processing to maximize performance.

AB We present SENTiVENT, a corpus of fine-grained company-specific events in English economic news articles. The domain of event processing is highly productive and various general domain, fine-grained event extraction corpora are freely available but economically-focused resources are lacking. This work fills a large need for a manually annotated dataset for economic and financial text mining applications. A representative corpus of business news is crawled and an annotation scheme developed with an iteratively refined economic event typology. The annotations are compatible with benchmark datasets (ACE/ERE) so state-of-the-art event extraction systems can be readily applied. This results in a gold-standard dataset annotated with event triggers, participant arguments, event co-reference, and event attributes such as type, subtype, negation, and modality. An adjudicated reference test set is created for use in annotator and system evaluation. Agreement scores are substantial and annotator performance adequate, indicating that the annotation scheme produces consistent event annotations of high quality. In an event detection pilot study, satisfactory results were obtained with a macro-averaged F-1-score of 59% validating the dataset for machine learning purposes. This dataset thus provides a rich resource on events as training data for supervised machine learning for economic and financial applications. The dataset and related source code is made available at .

AB We examine peripheral interactions in XR environments, for which we propose a conceptual space with two specialized dimensions, interaction-attention and reality-virtuality. We also formalize the notion of an "XR display" to expand the application range of ambient displays from physical environments to XR. To operationalize these conceptual contributions for researchers and practitioners, we capitalize on Sapiens, an open-source event-based software architecture for peripheral interactions in smart environments, to propose Sapiens-in-XR, an extended architecture that also covers XR displays. In a simulation study based on a Poisson probabilistic model of notification delivery, we demonstrate the efficiency of the event processing pipeline of Sapiens-in-XR with an average processing time of just 18ms from event creation to delivery. We present simulations of peripheral interaction scenarios enabled by our conceptual space and Sapiens-in-XR, and report empirical results from a controlled experiment implementing one scenario, where users were asked to maintain their focus of attention in the central field of view while notifications were displayed at the attention periphery. Our results show similar user perception and the same level of user performance for understanding and recalling content of notifications in either the virtual and physical environments. Our conceptual space, software architecture, and simulator constitute tools meant to assist researchers and practitioners to explore, design, and implement peripheral interactions in XR.

AB Post-Event Processing (PEP) is prevalent and problematic in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) but is typically not a direct target in evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for SAD. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the impact of several theoretically and empirically derived interventions for PEP in SAD, including concrete thinking, abstract thinking, and distraction in comparison to a control (i.e., do nothing) condition. Based on prior research, we hypothesized that the concrete and distract conditions would be associated with positive benefits, including reductions in PEP and improvements in self-perception, whereas the abstract and control conditions would not. The second aim of the study was to identify baseline variables that predict the trajectory of change in PEP over time. Participants (N=92) with a principal diagnosis of SAD completed a social stress task and were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Participants completed measures at baseline, post-intervention/control, and at 1-week, and 1-month follow-up. Contrary to hypotheses, all three active conditions were similarly effective at reducing PEP and improving self-perceptions relative to the control condition. In the absence of an intervention, engagement in PEP remained high up to a month following the social stress task. Higher levels of baseline state anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and use of safety behaviours predicted greater PEP, even in the presence of an intervention. These results highlight the benefits of relatively brief interventions that disrupt the course of PEP for people with SAD. Such interventions can be easily incorporated into CBT protocols for SAD to enhance their effects.

TI A Formal Framework for Complex Event Recognition
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS
DT Article
DE Complex event recognition; complex event processing; streaming
   evaluation; constant delay enumeration
AB Complex event recognition (CER) has emerged as the unifying field for technologies that require processing and correlating distributed data sources in real time. CER finds applications in diverse domains, which has resulted in a large number of proposals for expressing and processing complex events. Existing CER languages lack a clear semantics, however, which makes them hard to understand and generalize. Moreover, there are no general techniques for evaluating CER query languages with clear performance guarantees.
   In this article, we embark on the task of giving a rigorous and efficient framework to CER. We propose a formal language for specifying complex events, called complex event logic (CEL), that contains the main features used in the literature and has a denotational and compositional semantics. We also formalize the so-called selection strategies, which had only been presented as by-design extensions to existing frameworks. We give insight into the language design trade-offs regarding the strict sequencing operators of CEL and selection strategies.
   With a well-defined semantics at hand, we discuss how to efficiently process complex events by evaluating CEL formulas with unary filters. We start by introducing a formal computational model for CER, called complex event automata (CEA), and study how to compile CEL formulas with unary filters into CEA. Furthermore, we provide efficient algorithms for evaluating CEA over event streams using constant time per event followed by output-linear delay enumeration of the results.

AB When NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) was established almost a half century ago, the concept of computer-based service delivery was impractical or infeasible due to the state of information technology As a result, the interface the DSN exposes to its customers tends to be equipment-centric, lacking a clear demarcation between the DSN and the mission operation systems (MOS) of its customers. As the number of customers has continued to increase, the need to improve efficiency and minimize costs has grown. This growth has been the impetus for a DSN transformation from an equipment-forrent provider to a provider of standard services. Service orientation naturally leads to requirements for service management, including proactive measurement of service quality and service levels as well as the efficiency of internal processes and the performance of service provisioning systems.(1)
   DSN System Engineering has surveyed industry offerings to determine if commercial successes in decision support and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions can be applied to the DSN. A pilot project was initiated, and subsequently executed to determine the feasibility of repurposing a commercial Business Intelligence platform for engineering analysis in conjunction with the platform's intended business reporting and analysis functions. (2)
   This paper surveys the challenges, the lessons learned, and highlights the interesting results to date. It will also highlight the technologies applied to achieve these goals including:
   Business Intelligence Software
   Data Warehousing
   ETL (Extract, Translate and Load) techniques
   Complex Event Processing

AB The ATLAS experiment observes proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC accelerator at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV with a peak luminosity of similar to 10(33) cm(-2)s(-1) in 2011. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects interesting events on-line in a three-level trigger system in order to store them at a budgeted average rate of similar to 400 Hz for an event size of similar to 1.2 MB. This paper focuses on the TDAQ data-logging system. Its purpose is to receive events from the third level trigger, process them and stream the data into different raw files according to the trigger decision. The system currently in production is based on an essentially single-threaded design that is anticipated not to cope with the increase in event rate and event size foreseen as part of the ATLAS and LHC upgrade programs. This design also severely limits the possibility of performing additional CPU-intensive tasks. Therefore, a novel design able to exploit the full power of multi-core architecture is needed. The main challenge of such a design is the conflict between the largely parallel nature of the data-logging event processing and the constraint of sequential file writing. In this paper, we present a thread-pool based implementation of the TDAQ data-logging software. We report here on the functionality and performance of the new system and on our development experience.

AB Impaired facial affect recognition is characteristic of schizophrenia and has been related to impaired social function, but the relevant neural mechanisms have not been fully identified. The present study sought to identify the role of oscillatory alpha activity in that deficit during the process of facial emotion recognition. Neuromagnetic brain activity was monitored while 44 schizophrenia patients and 44 healthy controls viewed 5-s videos showing human faces gradually changing from neutral to fearful or happy expressions or from the neutral face of one poser to the neutral face of another. Recognition performance was determined separately by self-report. Relative to prestimulus baseline, controls exhibited a 10- to 15-Hz power increase prior to full recognition and a 10- to 15-Hz power decrease during the postrecognition phase. These results support recent proposals about the function of alpha-band oscillations in normal stimulus evaluation. The patients failed to show this sequence of alpha power increase and decrease and also showed low 10- to 15-Hz power and high 10- to 15-Hz connectivity during the prestimulus baseline. In light of the proposal that a combination of alpha power increase and functional disconnection facilitates information intake and processing, the finding of an abnormal association of low baseline alpha power and high connectivity in schizophrenia suggests a state of impaired readiness that fosters abnormal dynamics during facial affect recognition.

AB Supply chain event management exploits synergies between IT and logistics and refers to the set of methods and technologies used to efficiently integrate events from all actors and processes of the supply chain. In the context of supply chain event management, we examine how events can be used to leverage situation awareness. In our approach, situation awareness is facilitated by providing the capability to detect situations, which are represented as correlations between simple events, complex events and supply chain objects (e.g., suppliers, 3PL companies, retailers and material resources). We introduce a two-phase event correlation method which first correlates simple events into complex events and then events with supply chain objects. We describe how the proposed model has been implemented in a software framework and we conduct evaluation tests to examine its situation detection capabilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI NeutronStream: A Dynamic GNN Training Framework with Sliding Window for
   Graph Streams
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
DT Article
AB Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) training frameworks have been designed to help developers easily create performant GNN implementations. However, most existing GNN frameworks assume that the input graphs are static, but ignore that most real-world graphs are constantly evolving. Though many dynamic GNN models have emerged to learn from evolving graphs, the training process of these dynamic GNNs is dramatically different from traditional GNNs in that it captures both the spatial and temporal dependencies of graph updates. This poses new challenges for designing dynamic GNN training frameworks. First, the traditional batched training method fails to capture real-time structural evolution information. Second, the time-dependent nature makes parallel training hard to design. Third, it lacks system supports for users to efficiently implement dynamic GNNs. In this paper, we present NeutronStream, a framework for training dynamic GNN models. NeutronStream abstracts the input dynamic graph into a chronologically updated stream of events and processes the stream with an optimized sliding window to incrementally capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of events. Furthermore, NeutronStream provides a parallel execution engine to tackle the sequential event processing challenge to achieve high performance. NeutronStream also integrates a built-in graph storage structure that supports dynamic updates and provides a set of easy-to-use APIs that allow users to express their dynamic GNNs. Our experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art dynamic GNN implementations, NeutronStream achieves speedups ranging from 1.48X to 5.87X and an average accuracy improvement of 3.97%.

AB ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a heavy-ion detector studying the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). During the second long shut-down of the LHC, the ALICE detector was upgraded to cope with an interaction rate of 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions, producing in the online computing system (O-2) a sustained input throughput of 3.5 TB/s.
   In the past years, the O-2/FLP project built the new data-acquisition system capable of handling this load. It consists of 200 readout nodes, collecting the data transferred from over 8000 detector links to PCs memory by dedicated PCI boards. The readout software manages the hardware and software memory buffers used for DMA and inter-process communication. It initiates the data flow, performs on-the-fly consistency checks, formats the data, reports performance, and finally pushes the data to the local processing pipeline. The output is then sent by the data distribution software over 100Gb/s links to a dedicated event processing farm.
   The readout software modular design allowed to address the manifold needs faced during the prototyping, installation and commissioning phases, which proved essential from the lab tests to physics production, like file replay and recording, or online multi-threaded LZ4 compression.
   We will describe the hardware and software implementation of the O-2 readout system, and review the challenges met during the commissioning and first months of operation with LHC collisions in 2022.

AB With the proliferation of heterogeneous services in scalable Internet-of-Things (IoT) architectures, the Cloud of Things begins to face latency-based network challenges. As a solution to these problems, the Fog-of-Things (FoT) paradigm has emerged. This paradigm promises numerous benefits for latency-sensitive IoT service design, by reducing IoT data traffic toward the cloud. Since FoT utilizes heterogeneous services, the decision outputs of these services are transmitted by multipriority data packet traffic patterns. For the full utilization of fog computing benefits, we need to model this traffic and apply an efficient data traffic scheduling approach. In this study, we address the starvation challenge of multipriority FoT data traffic scheduling in a scalable fog architecture and propose a complex event processing-based efficient scheduling policy for its prevention. We first give the arrival-service model for FoT data traffic using finite-size multilevel waiting lines. Then, we compare the proposed policy with the first-in-first-out and multipriority-discipline queue policies through a comprehensive analysis of waiting times and wait-time gap characteristics. We have also conducted extensive simulation tests to explore the performance of these policies in our testbed for up to 800 clients communicating with the fog system. The results reveal that the empirical values obtained from the tests verify the theoretical model and the proposed approach can successfully relieve the waiting-time gaps observed in priority levels.

AB CMS has developed a strategy to efficiently exploit the multicore architecture of the compute resources accessible to the experiment. A coherent use of the multiple cores available in a compute node yields substantial gains in terms of resource utilization. The implemented approach makes use of the multithreading support of the event processing framework :and the multicore scheduling capabilities of the resource provisioning system. Multicore slots are acquired and provisioned by means Of multicore pilot agents which internally schedule :and execute single and multicore payloads. Multicore scheduling and multithreaded processing are currently used in production for online event selection and prompt data reconstruction. More workflows are being adapted to run in multicore mode. This paper presents a review of the experience gained in the deployment and operation of the multicore scheduling and processing system, the current status and future plans.

AB In this paper, we describe the SMILE (Smart MIddleware, Light Ends) system which is one of the earliest systems built in the area of distributed event strewn processing. SMILE unites the "publish-subscribe" model of messaging middleware with the "continuous query" model of database systems. In SMILE, information producers, which may be sensors, applications, or databases, generate streams of events, such as RFID data, news items or stock trades; consumers specify stateful subscriptions to derived views, such as "individuals trading top 5 total volume of stock Y within x minutes before a major news Story about the same company Y"; the SMILE system constructs and deploys a dataflow network of computations which process events from producers, compute derived views and deliver continuous and timely updates of subscribed views to consumers. Research challenges addressed by SMILE include: rigorously defining the semantics for correct state delivery; implementing this semantics in the presence of failure; distributing computations optimally over a network of multiple servers; scheduling and controlling message flow in this network; smoothly integrating this technology with other components, e.g., databases, services, user interfaces. SMILE is applicable to any "sense and respond" scenario that requires monitoring and processing of events as they are generated. Applications span multiple industries, e.g., monitoring financial opportunities and detecting potential fraud in financial industry, systems management and alerts in data centers, inventory management in RFID applications, and business performance management. In this paper, we describe the SMILE system, its architecture, services supported, and implementation details, and its use in multiple application scenarios.

TI Optimistic parallel simulation of a large-scale view storage system
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
DT Article
DE optimistic parallel simulation; reverse computation; view storage
   systems
AB In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a complex view storage system model. Here, a hierarchy of view storage servers are connected to an array of client-side local disks. The term view refers to the output or result of a query made on the part of an application that is executing on a client machine. These queries can to be arbitrarily complex and formulated using SQL. The goal of this system is to reduce the turnaround time of queries by exploiting locality both at the local disk level as well as between clients and servers prior to making the request to the highest level database server. This model has been designed for execution with an optimistic simulation engine. One of the primary drawbacks of this parallel synchronization mechanism has been high overheads due to state-saving. We attack this problem by implementing the model using reverse computation. Here, the event processing routines are made reversible, which avoids having incrementally state-saving values that can be reverse computed, such as ++ and --. Destructive assignments of the form a = b are saved using a swap operation, which precludes the need for additional state space. In our performance study of this application, we find that speedups range from 1.5 to over 5 on four processors. Super-linear speedups are attributed to a slow memory subsystem and the increased availability of level-1 and level-2 cache when moving to a larger number of processors.

AB European Spallation Source (ESS) will deliver neutrons at high flux for use in diverse neutron scattering techniques. The neutron source facility and the scientific instruments will be located in Lund, and the Data Management and Software Centre (DMSC), in Copenhagen. A number of detector prototypes are being developed at ESS together with its European in-kind partners, for example: SoNDe, Multi-Grid, Multi-Blade and Gd-GEM. These are all position sensitive detectors but use different techniques for the detection of neutrons. Except for digitization of electronics readout, all neutron data is anticipated to be processed in software. This provides maximum flexibility and adaptability and allows deep inspection of the raw data for commissioning which will reduce the risk of starting up new detector technologies. But it also requires development of high performance software processing pipelines and optimized and scalable processing algorithms. This report provides a description of the ESS system architecture for the neutron data path. Special focus is on the interface between the detectors and DMSC which is based on UDP over Ethernet links. The report also describes the software architecture for detector data processing and the tools we have developed, which have proven very useful for efficient early experimentation, and can be run on a single laptop. Processing requirements for the SoNDe, Multi-Grid, Multi-Blade and Ge-GEM detectors are presented and compared to event processing rates archived so far.

AB Spatial function is one of the cognitive functions altered in the presence of cerebellar lesions. We investigated the cerebellar contribution to the acquisition of spatial procedural and working memory components by means of a radial maze. To establish whether a cerebellar lesion would cause a deficit in solving the radial maze, a first experiment was carried out by using a full-baited maze procedure in different experimental groups, with or without cerebellar lesion and with or without pretraining. Non-pretrained hemicerebellectomized (HCbed) animals exhibited impaired performances in all (motor, spatial and procedural) task aspects. Pre-trained HCbed animals performed similarly to control animals in the task aspects linked to the processing of spatial and procedural factors. To distinguish procedural from working memory components, a forced-choice paradigm of the radial maze was used in the second experiment. Non-pretrained HCbed rats continued to make a lot of errors and show severe perseverative tendencies, already observed in the first experiment, supporting a specific cerebellar role in acquiring new behaviours and in modifying them in relation to the context. Interestingly, hindered from putting the acquired explorative patterns into action and compelled to use only working memory abilities, the pretrained HCbed group exhibited a dramatic worsening of performance. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that cerebellar damage induces a specific behaviour in radial maze tasks, characterized by an inflexible use of the procedures (if indeed any procedure was acquired before the lesion) and by a severe impairment in working memory processes.

AB Recently, there is growing interest in directly digitizing the scintillation pulses in PET detectors. With digital pulse samples, in principle one can apply nontrivial signal analysis software algorithms to either yield better detection performance or more flexibility in detector design. Previously, we have proposed the MVT method for direct scintillation pulse sampling and developed several kinds of digital PET detectors named basic detector modules (BDM). These highly modular detectors output the resulting MVT samples in a uniform data format via a RJ45 connector while adopting the UDP protocol. For PET systems based on these detectors, single-event processing and coincidence filtering are all carried out by softwares. As a result, new processing/filtering methods can be readily updated or upgraded. Therefore, we wish to provide a BDM based design architecture to enable quick setup of a PET system. We use two system geometry definition files, named the SG file1 and SG file2, to define the types and number of the BDMs employed, as well as their positions and orientations. The MVT data processing like single event information retrieving, coincidence filtering, data format conversion, image reconstruction and data/image analysis are carried out by separate software modules with standard input and output definitions. Those software modules can be conveniently modified or replaced, and be put into cascade chains to provide desired functions. In this work, we present such a BDM based system design architecture, as well as the BDMs newly developed. As an example, a panel PET system adopting this architecture with 12 BDMs is shown with phantom imaging result.

AB This paper proposes a concept for a prescriptive control of business processes by using event-based process predictions. In this regard, it explores new potentials through the application of predictive analytics to big data while focusing on production planning and control in the context of the process manufacturing industry. This type of industry is an adequate application domain for the conceived concept, since it features several characteristics that are opposed to conventional industries such as assembling ones. These specifics include divergent and cyclic material flows, high diversity in end products' qualities, as well as non-linear production processes that are not fully controllable. Based on a case study of a German steel producing company - a typical example of the process industry - the work at hand outlines which data becomes available when using state-of-the-art sensor technology and thus providing the required basis to realize the proposed concept. However, a consideration of the data size reveals that dedicated methods of big data analytics are required to tap the full potential of this data. Consequently, the paper derives seven requirements that need to be addressed for a successful implementation of the concept. Additionally, the paper proposes a generic architecture of prescriptive enterprise systems. This architecture comprises five building blocks of a system that is capable to detect complex event patterns within a multi-sensor environment, to correlate them with historical data and to calculate predictions that are finally used to recommend the best course of action during process execution in order to minimize or maximize certain key performance indicators.

TI Mobiiscape: Middleware support for scalable mobility pattern monitoring

AB With the explosive proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and sensor nodes, location-based services are getting even more attention than before, considered as one of the killer applications in the upcoming mobile computing era. Developing location-based services necessarily requires an effective and scalable location data processing technology. In this paper, we present Mobiiscape, a novel location monitoring system that collectively monitors mobility patterns of a large number of moving objects in a large-scale city to support city-wide mobility-aware applications. Mobiiscape provides an SQL-like query language named Moving Object Monitoring Query Language (MQL) that allows applications to intuitively specify Mobility Pattern Monitoring Queries (MPQs). Further, Mobiiscape provides a set of scalable location monitoring techniques to efficiently process a large number of MPQs over a large number of location streams. The scalable processing techniques include a (1) Place Border Index, a spatial index for quickly searching for relevant queries upon receiving location streams, (2) Place-Based Window, a spatial-purpose window for efficiently detecting primitive mobility patterns, (3)Shared NFA, a shared query processing technique for efficiently matching complex mobility patterns, and (4) Attribute Pre-matching Bitmap, an in-memory data structure for efficiently filtering out moving objects based on their attributes. We have implemented a Mobiiscape prototype system. Then, we show the usefulness of the system by implementing promising location-based applications based on it such as a ubiquitous taxicab service and a location-based advertising. Also, we demonstrate the performance benefit of the system through extensive evaluation and comparison. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the science motivation, measurement objectives, performance requirements, detailed design, approach and implementation, and calibration of the four Hot Plasma Composition Analyzers (HPCA) for the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. The HPCA is based entirely on electrostatic optics combining an electrostatic energy analyzer with a carbon-foil based time-of-flight analyzer. In order to fulfill mission requirements, the HPCA incorporates three unique technologies that give it very wide dynamic range capabilities essential to measuring minor ion species in the presence of extremely high proton fluxes found in the region of magnetopause reconnection. Dynamic range is controlled primarily by a novel radio frequency system analogous to an RF mass spectrometer. The RF, in combination with capabilities for high TOF event processing rates and high current micro-channel plates, ensures the dynamic range and sensitivity needed for accurate measurements of ion fluxes between similar to 1 eV and 40 keV that are expected in the region of reconnection events. A third technology enhances mass resolution in the presence of high proton flux.
   In order to calibrate the four HPCA instruments we have developed a unique ion calibration system. The system delivers a multi-species beam resolved to M/Delta M similar to 100 and current densities between 0.05 and 200 pA/cm(2) with a stability of +/- 5 %. The entire system is controlled by a dedicated computer synchronized with the HPCA ground support equipment. This approach results not only in accurate calibration but also in a comprehensive set of coordinated instrument and auxiliary data that makes analysis straightforward and ensures archival of all relevant data.

AB Increasing complexity and data-generation rates in cyber-physical systems and the industrial Internet of things are calling for a corresponding increase in AI capabilities at the resource-constrained edges of the Internet. Meanwhile, the resource requirements of digital computing and deep learning are growing exponentially, in an unsustainable manner. One possible way to bridge this gap is the adoption of resource-efficient brain-inspired "neuromorphic" processing and sensing devices, which use event-driven, asynchronous, dynamic neurosynaptic elements with colocated memory for distributed processing and machine learning. However, since neuromorphic systems are fundamentally different from conventional von Neumann computers and clock-driven sensor systems, several challenges are posed to large-scale adoption and integration of neuromorphic devices into the existing distributed digital-computational infrastructure. Here, we describe the current landscape of neuromorphic computing, focusing on characteristics that pose integration challenges. Based on this analysis, we propose a microservice-based conceptual framework for neuromorphic systems integration, consisting of a neuromorphic-system proxy, which would provide virtualization and communication capabilities required in distributed systems of systems, in combination with a declarative programming approach offering engineering-process abstraction. We also present concepts that could serve as a basis for the realization of this framework, and identify directions for further research required to enable large-scale system integration of neuromorphic devices.

AB Socially anxious individuals tend to have elevated levels of perfectionism and engage in excessive rumination following social situations. The present research aimed to examine perfectionism, in both state and trait forms, as a predictor of post-event rumination. Socially anxious students (N = 104) completed measures of trait perfectionism prior to, and state perfectionism following, an anxiety inducing speech task. Post-event rumination was assessed 2 days later. State and trait perfectionism were significant predictors of post-event rumination (2 days later), while controlling for baseline social anxiety, depression and state anxiety. These results support the need to target perfectionism in treatments for social anxiety disorder.

AB During the past few years, with the fast development and proliferation of the Internet of Things (ToT), many application areas have started to exploit this new computing paradigm. The number of active computing devices has been growing at a rapid pace in IoT environments around the world. Consequently, a mechanism to deal with this different devices has become necessary. Middleware systems solutions for IoT have been developed in both research and industrial environments to supply this need. However, decision analytics remain a critical challenge. In this work we present the Decision Support IoT Framework composed of COBASEN, an IoT search engine to address the research challenge regarding the discovery and selection of IoT devices when large number of devices with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available in IoT middleware systems, and DMS, a rule-based reasoner engine allowing to set up computational analytics on device data when it is still in motion, extracting valuable information from it for automated decision making. DMS uses Complex Event Processing to analyze and react over streaming data, allowing for example, to trigger an actuator when a specific error or condition appears in the stream. The main goal of this work is to highlight the importance of a decision support system for decision analytics in the IoT paradigm. We developed a system which implements DMS concepts. However, for preliminarily tests, we made a functional evaluation of both systems in terms of performance. Our initial findings suggest that the Decision Support IoT Framework provides important approaches that facilitate the development of IoT applications, and provides a new way to see how the business rules and decision-making will be made towards the Internet of Things.

AB Determining the location of crystals within detector arrays (position profile) is a crucial part of system tuning in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners. It provides a basis for the mapping of detected events and the most probable crystal location to a(s)sign the event. Accurate assignments are crucial for proper coincidence event processing and reconstructed image resolution. In high resolution imaging systems, image resolution is of primary importance and proper position profiles are a critical part of system tuning. The High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner is composed of 936 detector blocks each with 64 dual layer crystals arranged in grids. Significant engineer time is spent fixing errors in the automated position profile estimation software used for system tuning. We have developed a probabilistic approach to position profile estimation and applied it to the HRRT PET system. Our approach is composed of a segmentation model for crosstalk filtering, a prior over valid position profile configurations, and a grid partitioning algorithm for crystal location finding. Our model outperforms the manufacturer supplied position profile estimation software, yielding a 39% decrease in mean squared error rate as compared to a gold standard configuration in the HRRT, while being a general solution applicable to many detector array configurations.

AB ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the heavy-ion detector designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). ALICE has been successfully collecting physics data of Run 2 since spring 2015. In parallel, preparations for a major upgrade, called 02 (Online-Offline) and scheduled for the Long Shutdown 2 in 2019-2020, are being made. One of the major requirements is the capacity to transport data between so-called FLPs (First Level Processors), equipped with readout cards, and the EPNs (Event Processing Node), performing data aggregation, frame building and partial reconstruction. It is foreseen to have 268 FLPs dispatching data to 1500 EPNs with an average output of 20 Gb/s each. In overall, the 02 processing system will operate at terabits per second of throughput while handling millions of concurrent connections. To meet these requirements, the software and hardware layers of the new system need to be fully evaluated. In order to achieve a high performance to cost ratio three networking technologies (Ethernet, InfiniBand and Omni-Path) were benchmarked on Intel and IBM platforms. The core of the new transport layer will be based on a message queue library that supports push-pull and request-reply communication patterns and multipart messages. ZeroMQ and nanomsg are being evaluated as candidates and were tested in detail over the selected network technologies. This paper describes the benchmark programs and setups that were used during the tests, the significance of tuned kernel parameters, the configuration of network driver and the tuning of multi-core, multi-CPU, and NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture. It presents, compares and comments the final results. Eventually, it indicates the most efficient network technology and message queue library pair and provides an evaluation of the needed CPU and memory resources to handle foreseen traffic.

AB In this paper we address the problem of scalable, native and adaptive query processing over Linked Stream Data integrated with Linked Data. Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a "black box" approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efficiency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams), a native and adaptive query processor for unified query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a "white box" approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a flexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude.

AB In 2010 ATLAS has seen the first proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV. This year a collision rate of nearly 10 MHz has been achieved. Events of potential interest for physics analysis are selected by a three-level trigger system, with a final recording rate of about 200 Hz. The first level (L1) is implemented in customized hardware, the two levels of the high level trigger (HLT) are software triggers. The selection is described by the Trigger Configuration in the form of menus, each of which contains about 400 signatures. Each signature corresponds to a chain of algorithms which reconstruct and refine specific event features. The HLT Steering receives information from the Configuration system, dynamically creates chains and controls the execution of algorithms and flow of information during event processing. The Steering tests each signature on L1-accepted events, and those satisfying one or more test are recorded for later analysis. To save execution time, the Steering has a facility to cache results, avoiding later recalculation. To control rate, prescale factors can be applied to L1 or HLT signatures. Where needed for later analysis, the Steering has a test-after-accept functionality to provide the results of the tests for prescaled signatures. In order to maintain a high selection efficiency it is essential that the trigger can be dynamically re-configured in response to changes in the detector or machine conditions, such as the status of detector readout elements, instantaneous LHC luminosity and beam-spot position. This relies on techniques that allow configuration changes, such as L1 and HLT prescale updates, to be made during a run without disrupting data taking, while ensuring a consistent and reproducible configuration across the entire HLT farm. We present the performance of the trigger system during collisions, showing the evolution with LHC luminosity and briefly describe the expectations for the next phase of LHC exploitation.

AB In recent years, the application and wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies have increased the proliferation of monitoring systems, which has consequently exponentially increased the amounts of heterogeneous data generated. Processing and analysing the massive amount of data produced is cumbersome and gradually moving from classical 'batch' processing-extract, transform, load (ETL) technique to real-time processing. For instance, in environmental monitoring and management domain, time-series data and historical dataset are crucial for prediction models. However, the environmental monitoring domain still utilises legacy systems, which complicates the real-time analysis of the essential data, integration with big data platforms and reliance on batch processing. Herein, as a solution, a distributed stream processing middleware framework for real-time analysis of heterogeneous environmental monitoring and management data is presented and tested on a cluster using open source technologies in a big data environment. The system ingests datasets from legacy systems and sensor data from heterogeneous automated weather systems irrespective of the data types to Apache Kafka topics using Kafka Connect APIs for processing by the Kafka streaming processing engine. The stream processing engine executes the predictive numerical models and algorithms represented in event processing (EP) languages for real-time analysis of the data streams. To prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implemented the system using a case study scenario of drought prediction and forecasting based on the Effective Drought Index (EDI) model. Firstly, we transform the predictive model into a form that could be executed by the streaming engine for real-time computing. Secondly, the model is applied to the ingested data streams and datasets to predict drought through persistent querying of the infinite streams to detect anomalies. As a conclusion of this study, a performance evaluation of the distributed stream processing middleware infrastructure is calculated to determine the real-time effectiveness of the framework.

DE Internet of Things; Real-time event processing; Rule-based edge analytic
AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, with ubiquitous remote sensing devices and other diverse data sources, nearly everything can forward voluminous data continuously, in realtime, which drives demand to perform real-time analytics on uninterrupted IoT data flows. The typical resultant approach is a cloud-centered architecture providing an analytic service for real-time IoT data processing. However, a cloud-centered IoT analytic service cannot guarantee real-time responsiveness has a high-fee pay-as-you-go business model, and opens data privacy concerns. Hence, it becomes rational to shift analytic workloads to the edge and provide a management service for edge analysis. Existing work on providing edge analytics as a service encountered challenges such as lacking a lightweight way to compose IoT applications based on multiple service providers, lacking a flexible and unified way to define domainspecific analytic logic, and maintaining efficiency when processing data on a resource-limited edge. This paper presents EAaaS, a scalable analytic service for enabling realtime edge analytics in IoT scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified rule-based analytic model to ease user's programming efforts in specifying rule-based analytic logic. Moreover, we also designed and implemented a high performance edge engine to apply rule-based analytic on incoming device data streams. To simplify the access to EAaaS service, a group of RESTful web interfaces is also designed for edge analytic management on cloud and flexible composition with external services. EAaaS is implemented as a part of IBM Watson IoT Platform, which is a cloud service for elementary IoT application development on IBM Bluemix cloud announced by IBM recently. We have conducted proof of correctness (PoC) of EAaaS with customers from boat racing in the U. S. and collected valuable feedback from customers for further enhancement of EAaaS's flexibility and usability.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Detector optimisation and physics performance studies are an integral part of the development of future collider experiments. The Key4hep project aims to design a common set of software tools for future, or even present, High Energy Physics projects. Based on the iLCSoft and FCCSW frameworks an integrated solution for detector simulation, reconstruction and analyses is being developed. This presentation will give a short overview of the major ingredients of the Key4hep turnkey software; the common event datamodel - EDM4hep, the Gaudi based event processing framework, some dedicated packages developed on top of these, and the use of the Spack package manager, which enables installations on a variety of platforms. A first example highlights the synergies that were already achieved by the collaboration of the different collider communities (CEPC, CLIC, FCC, ILC). It shows the seamless integration of fast simulation with Delphes and the LCFIplus vertexing processor from iLCSoft. This combination is possible due to EDM4hep, the processor wrapper (k4MarlinWrapper), and the k4SimDelphes framework integration in Key4hep. As a second example, the multi-threaded execution of the iLCSoft processors in the Gaudi framework making use of the k4MarlinWrapper will be showcased. The third example will demonstrate the execution of a multi-threaded simulation of a drift chamber in the CEPC experiment. The chosen application will take information of primary ionizations generated by an incident charged particle as input and will create the waveform as the final output, which represents the signal collected by the chamber's signal wire. The simulation algorithm is based on a neural network model which can be used to simulate the effects from the ionization electron's drift and avalanches. Using these examples we review some of the challenges and issues that we encountered as well as how they were addressed in the end. We close with a brief discussion of the next steps for the Key4hep project.

AB The reconstruction of trajectories of the charged particles in the tracking detectors of high energy physics (HEP) experiments is one of the most difficult and complex tasks of event reconstruction at particle colliders. As pattern recognition algorithms exhibit combinatorial scaling to high track multiplicities, they become the largest contributor to the CPU consumption within event reconstruction, particularly at current and future hadron colliders such as the LHC, HL-LHC and FCC-hh. Current algorithms provide an extremely high standard of physics and computing performance and have been tested on billions of simulated and recorded data events. However, most algorithms date back to more than 20 years ago and maintaining them has become increasingly challenging. In addition, they are challenging to adapt to modern programming paradigms and parallel architectures.
   Acts is based on the well-tested and highly functioning components of LHC track reconstruction algorithms, implemented with modern software concepts and inherently designed for parallel architectures. Multithreading becomes increasingly important to balance the memory usage per CPU core. However, a fully multithreaded event processing framework blurs the clear border between events, which has in the past often been used as a clearly defined validity boundary for event conditions. Acts is equipped with a full contextual conditions concept that allows to run concurrent track reconstruction even in case of multiple detector alignments, conditions or varying magnetic field being processed at the same time. It provides an experiment and, in particular, framework-independent software toolkit and light-weight, highly optimised event data model for track reconstruction. Particular care is given to thread safety and data locality. It is designed as a toolbox that allows to implement and extend widely known pattern recognition algorithms, and in addition suitable for algorithm templating and R&D. Acts has been used as the fast simulation engine for the Tracking Machine Learning (TrackML) Challenge, and will provide reference implementation of several submitted solution programs of the two phases of the challenge.

AB We present a new time-accurate algorithm for the explicit numerical integration of the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. This technique is based on the discrete-event simulation (DES) methodology for nonlinear flux-conservative PDEs [Y.A. Omelchenko, H. Karimabadi, Self-adaptive time integration of flux-conservative equations with sources, J. Comput. Phys. 216 (1) (2006) 179-194]. DES enables adaptive distribution of CPU resources in accordance with local time scales of the underlying numerical solution. It distinctly stands apart from multiple (local) time-stepping algorithms in that it requires neither selecting a global synchronization time step nor pre-determining a sequence of time-integration operations for individual parts of a heterogeneous numerical system. In this paper we extend the DES methodology in three important directions: (i) we apply DES to a system of coupled gas dynamics equations discretized via a central-upwind scheme [A. Kurganov, E.

AB The pernicious impact of malicious Slow DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on the application layer and web-based Open Systems Interconnection model services like Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has given impetus to a range of novel detection strategies, many of which use machine learning (ML) for computationally intensive full packet capture and post-event processing. In contrast, existing detection mechanisms, such as those found in various approaches including ML, artificial intelligence, and neural networks neither facilitate real-time detection nor consider the computational overhead within resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Slow DoS attacks are notoriously difficult to reliably identify, as they masquerade as legitimate application layer traffic, often resembling nodes with slow or intermittent connectivity. This means they often evade detection mechanisms because they appear as genuine node activity, which increases the likelihood of mistakenly being granted access by intrusion-detection systems. The original contribution of this paper is an innovative Guardian Node (GN) Slow DoS detection model, which analyses the two key network attributes of packet length and packet delta time in real time within a live IoT network. By designing the GN to operate within a narrow window of packet length and delta time values, accurate detection of all three main Slow DoS variants is achieved, even under the stealthiest malicious attack conditions. A unique feature of the GN model is its ability to reliably discriminate Slow DoS attack traffic from both genuine and slow nodes experiencing high latency or poor connectivity. A rigorous critical evaluation has consistently validated high, real-time detection accuracies of more than 98% for the GN model across a range of demanding traffic profiles. This performance is analogous to existing ML approaches, whilst being significantly more resource efficient, with computational and storage overheads being over 96% lower than full packet capture techniques, so it represents a very attractive alternative for deployment in resource-scarce IoT environments.

AB This study investigated the influence of trait social anxiety on subjective and physiological responses to an anticipated stressor. Seventy normotensive female students characterized as either high or low in social anxiety engaged in a demanding speech task after an anticipation period of one week that provided opportunity to prepare for the task. Trait social anxiety substantially influenced objective and perceived physiological arousal. High socially anxious individuals displayed greater heart rate reactivity and greater increases in perceived arousal that were in excess of objective HR reactivity. Perceived, but not objective arousal, partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety and negative post-task reappraisals of perceived coping resources. Furthermore, self-evaluations were found to be an essential determinant of post-task rumination. The results provide support for central predictions of cognitive models on social phobia.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown significantly in popularity, accompanied by increased capacity and lower cost of communications, and overwhelming development of technologies. At the same time, big data and realtime data analysis have taken on great importance and have been accompanied by unprecedented interest in sharing data among citizens, public administrations and other organisms, giving rise to what is known as the Collaborative Internet of Things. This growth in data and infrastructure must be accompanied by a software architecture that allows its exploitation. Although there are various proposals focused on the exploitation of the IoT at edge, fog and/or cloud levels, it is not easy to find a software solution that exploits the three tiers together, taking maximum advantage not only of the analysis of contextual and situational data at each tier, but also of two-way communications between adjacent ones. In this paper, we propose an architecture that solves these deficiencies by proposing novel technologies which are appropriate for managing the resources of each tier: edge, fog and cloud. In addition, the fact that two-way communications along the three tiers of the architecture is allowed considerably enriches the contextual and situational information in each layer, and substantially assists decision making in real time. The paper illustrates the proposed software architecture through a case study of respiratory disease surveillance in hospitals. As a result, the proposed architecture permits efficient communications between the different tiers responding to the needs of these types of IoT scenarios.

AB ATLAS's current software framework, Gaudi/Athena, has been very successful for the experiment in LHC Runs 1 and 2. However, its single-threaded design has been recognised for some time to be increasingly problematic as CPUs have increased core counts and decreased available memory per core. Even the multi-process version of Athena, AthenaMP, will not scale to the range of architectures we expect to use beyond Run2.
   ATLAS examined the requirements on an updated multi-threaded framework and laid out plans for a new framework, including better support for High Level Trigger use cases, in 2014. In this paper we report on our progress in developing the new multi-threaded task parallel extension of Athena, AthenaMT.
   Implementing AthenaMT has required many significant code changes. Progress has been made in updating key concepts of the framework, allowing different levels of thread safety in algorithmic code. Substantial advances have also been made in implementing a data flow centric design, as well as on the development of the new 'event views' infrastructure. These event views support partial event processing and are an essential component to support the High Level Trigger's processing of certain regions of interest. A major effort has also been invested to have an early version of AthenaMT that can run simulation on many core architectures, which has augmented the understanding gained from work on earlier ATLAS demonstrators.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) services and technologies become more and more predominant in the current and future era of the Internet. Lot of devices and applications are developed and connected to the classical IP networks. As for any new network services testing and evaluation is made in the intranet environment in these days. Neither the efficiency measurement methods of the energy usage nor communication nor sustainability aspects of these services have been determined exactly. Well defined solutions based on statistical analysis are needed to gather practical knowledge about the sensor based network nodes. The errors of the collected data arise in different levels of the process. There are errors during the measurement of a given signal by the sensor, another type of errors is generated during the transmission of collected data through the sensor access network, finally the store process of the received data influenced by errors as well. Evaluation of the hardware and software resource usage by the services and applications are very dissimilar tasks from the classical wired or wireless data network situations in case of IoT. Because of the data streams coming from quite a number of sensors, the statistical analysis of several dozens or hundreds of time series become a complex processing problem. The time series affected by errors generate a preprocessing challenge, which depends on several simultaneous aspects like the measured signal, the applied IoT communication technology and the data storing mechanism. The statistical analysis methods of the time series originated from the preliminary processing differ from the classical data network performance evaluation methods since in the IoT streams are grouped in epoch time periods, for instance. Having huge number of several variables distributed in time and physical space which describes special aspects of the measured and/or controlled system implies complex event processing. This paper presents a case study for the complex data set which has been captured from 18 TFLOPS capacity supercomputer system with 1.5 thousand CPU cores.

TI Rapid Estimation of Single-Station Earthquake Magnitudes with Machine
   Learning on a Global Scale
SO BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
DT Article
ID SOURCE INVERSION; NEAR-FIELD; WAVE-FORMS; DEEP
AB The foundation of earthquake monitoring is the ability to rapidly detect, locate, and estimate the size of seismic sources. Earthquake magnitudes are particularly difficult to rapidly characterize because magnitude types are only applicable to specific magnitude ranges, and location errors propagate to substantial magnitude errors. We developed a method for rapid estimation of single-station earthquake magnitudes using raw three-component P waveforms observed at local to teleseismic distances, independent of prior size or location information. We used the MagNet regression model architecture (Mousavi and Beroza, 2020b), which combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We trained our model using similar to 2.4 million P-phase arrivals labeled by the authoritative magnitude assigned by the U.S. Geological Survey. We tested input data parameters (e.g., window length) that could affect the performance of our model in near-real-time monitoring applications. At the longest waveform window length of 114 s, our model (Artificial Intelligence Magnitude [AIMag]) is accurate (median estimated magnitude within +/- 0.5 magnitude units from catalog magnitude) between M 2.3 and 7.6. However, magnitudes above M similar to 7 are more underestimated as true magnitude increases. As the windows are shortened down to 1 s, the point at which higher magnitudes begin to be underestimated moves toward lower magnitudes, and the degree of underestimation increases. The over and underestimation of magnitudes for the smallest and largest earthquakes, respectively, are potentially related to the limited number of events in these ranges within the training data, as well as magnitude saturation effects related to not capturing the full source time function of large earthquakes. Importantly, AIMag can determine earthquake magnitudes with individual stations' waveforms without instrument response correction or knowledge of an earthquake's source-station distance. This work may enable monitoring agencies to more rapidly recognize large, potentially tsunamigenic global earthquakes from few stations, allowing for faster event processing and reporting. This is critical for timely warnings for seismic-related hazards.

AB We have developed a PET insert system that can be integrated into a clinical PET-CT scanner to improve its image resolution when imaging a patient for head and neck cancer. The system consists of 28 detector modules arranged into two half rings (24.6 cm in diameter). Each detector consists of an array of 13x13 LSO crystals each measuring 2 x 2 x 5 mm3, a 2.8 mm thick light-guide, and a R8900-M16 PMT (Hamamatsu, Japan). The 16 anode outputs of a PMT are multiplexed to produce 4 position-encoded signals that resemble the output of a typical block detector in the PET scanner. An active switch board was designed to select signals from either the insert detectors or scanner detectors and feed the output signals to system electronics for event processing, allowing the scanner to switch between its normal operation and the insert mode without shutting down the system. A 3-D translation stage supports and positions the insert concentrically inside the scanner. The axial extend of the insert detectors is 54 mm, centered within the first 3 detector block rings of the scanner. Initial setup of the PET insert system requires the identification of crystal lookup table and photopeak locations, timing alignment of the insert detectors with the scanner. Once completed, the scanner can be switched between the insert and normal modes within a few minutes. Coincidences are sorted into insert-insert (II), insert-scanner (IS) and scanner-scanner (SS) types of events using a custom sorting code. We have developed 2D FBP and 2D ML-EM algorithms to reconstruct single-slice rebinned sinograms, and a 3D OS-EM algorithm to jointly estimate the images using all 3 types of events. Initial tests show a mean, max and min energy resolution of 12.36%, 18.57% and 9.45% FWHM at 511 keV, respectively. Image resolution measured by 22Na point sources is similar to 2-3 mm FWHM and improved from 4-5mm FWHM for scanner system. Full system performance is currently being evaluated.

AB If last decade viewed computational services as a utility then surely this decade has transformed computation into a commodity. Computation is now progressively integrated into the physical networks in a seamless way that enables cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) meet their latency requirements. Similar to the concept of "platform as a service" or "software as a service", both cloudlets and fog computing have found their own use cases. Edge devices (that we call end or user devices for disambiguation) play the role of personal computers, dedicated to a user and to a set of correlated applications. In this new scenario, the boundaries between the network node, the sensor, and the actuator are blurring, driven primarily by the computation power of IoT nodes like single board computers and the smartphones. The bigger data generated in this type of networks needs clever, scalable, and possibly decentralized computing solutions that can scale independently as required. Any node can be seen as part of a graph, with the capacity to serve as a computing or network router node, or both. Complex applications can possibly be distributed over this graph or network of nodes to improve the overall performance like the amount of data processed over time. In this paper, we identify this new computing paradigm that we call Social Dispersed Computing, analyzing key themes in it that includes a new outlook on its relation to agent based applications. We architect this new paradigm by providing supportive application examples that include next generation electrical energy distribution networks, next generation mobility services for transportation, and applications for distributed analysis and identification of non-recurring traffic congestion in cities. The paper analyzes the existing computing paradigms (e.g., cloud, fog, edge, mobile edge, social, etc.), solving the ambiguity of their definitions; and analyzes and discusses the relevant foundational software technologies, the remaining challenges, and research opportunities.

AB Objective: For efficient and sophisticated analysis of complex event patterns that appear in streams of big data from health care information systems and support for decision-making, a triaxial hierarchical model is proposed in this paper.
   Methods and material: Our triaxial hierarchical model is developed by focusing on hierarchies among nested event pattern queries with an event concept hierarchy, thereby allowing us to identify the relationships among the expressions and sub-expressions of the queries extensively. We devise a cost-based heuristic by means of the triaxial hierarchical model to find an optimised query execution plan in terms of the costs of both the operators and the communications between them. According to the triaxial hierarchical model, we can also calculate how to reuse the results of the common sub-expressions in multiple queries. By integrating the optimised query execution plan with the reuse schemes, a multi query optimisation strategy is developed to accomplish efficient processing of multiple nested event pattern queries.
   Results: We present empirical studies in which the performance of multi-query optimisation strategy was examined under various stream input rates and workloads. Specifically, the workloads of pattern queries can be used for supporting monitoring patients' conditions. On the other hand, experiments with varying input rates of streams can correspond to changes of the numbers of patients that a system should manage, whereas burst input rates can correspond to changes of rushes of patients to be taken care of. The experimental results have shown that, in Workload 1, our proposal can improve about 4 and 2 times throughput comparing with the relative works, respectively; in Workload 2, our proposal can improve about 3 and 2 times throughput comparing with the relative works, respectively; in Workload 3, our proposal can improve about 6 times throughput comparing with the relative work.
   Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrated that our proposal was able to process complex queries efficiently which can support health information systems and further decision-making. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Learning model from the execution traces has been considered in several domains such as traffic classification, malware detection, and software engineering since it distinguishes which processes actually executed through their traces. Behavioral model learning and classification (in terms of learned models) are taken into accounts to eliminate the shortages of models derived based on non-behavioral features and improve the resulting classifications. So far, no general method has been proposed to automatically derive behavioral models. To this aim, we assume that the models of applications can be abstractly defined in terms of how they execute their depending components, well-known in the domain. To automatically derive such models, we extend the passive automata learning by considering the behavior of the depending components in addition to the observed behaviors. The state merging algorithm of the learning process is equipped with a new equivalence relation which aggregate states modulo counter abstraction of symmetric reduction. To improve the generated model to cover unobserved behaviors, we leverage the technique of complex event processing to complete the model with the unseen interleaving of actions due to the concurrent execution of components. The derived models, specified by parametrized transition systems, can distinguish different executions of instances of each component by assigning a unique symbolic identifier to each instantiation and parameterizing actions with such identifiers.
   The learned models are used to distinguish the executions of applications in an interleaved execution trace of different systems. The detection procedure is more complicated for parametric models because of the need for relating the information of the trace to symbolic identifiers as the parameters. We utilize runtime verification techniques in a three-step novel approach so as to enhance the performance of the matching process for a trace.
   To illustrate the applicability of our approach, we have employed it for traffic classification in the network domain and then applied it on some real applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in this domain, we compare it to related approaches in terms of their true positive rate, false positive rate, and test time. Our results indicate that our technique prevents including invalid traces so that unobserved behaviors are covered with an acceptable precision. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose of Review To review data published in the past 5 years to evaluate the utility of our biopsychosocial model of social anxiety's relation to substance misuse to evaluate the model's utility and update it. Recent Findings Data support the utility of our revised model-e.g., socially anxious persons report using substances to manage subjective anxiety, despite evidence that some substances may not have a direct effect on physiological responding. Other factors with promise include social influence, cognitive processes (e.g., post-event processing), and avoidance. Data highlight the importance of context as socially anxious persons use some substances more in some high-risk situations, despite lack of relation between social anxiety and use generally. Sociocultural factors remain understudied. This updated model is a theory- and data-driven model of the relations between social anxiety and substance misuse that can inform future work to improve substance-related outcomes among this especially vulnerable group.

AB The development of a prototype dual-modality optical and PET (OPET) small animal imaging tomograph is underway in the Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging at the University of California Los Angeles. OPET consists of a single ring of six detector modules with a diameter of 3.5 cm. Each detector has an. 8 x 8 array of optically isolated 1360 scintillators which are coupled to multichannel photomultiplier tubes and open on the front end. The system operates in either PET or optical mode and reconstructs the data sets as 3D tomograms. The detectors are capable of detecting both annihilation events (511 keV) from PET tracers as well as Single Photon Events (SPEs) (2-3 eV) from bioluminescence. Detector channels are readout using a custom multiplex readout scheme and then filtered in analog circuitry using either a gamma-ray or SPE specific filter. Shaped pulses are sent to a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) unit. for event processing. The DSP unit has 100 MHz Analog-to-Digital Converters on the front-end which send digitized samples to Field Programmable Gate Arrays which are programmed via user configurable algorithms to process PET - coincidence events or bioluminescence SPEs. Information determined using DSP includes: event timing, energy determination-discrimination, position determination-lookup, and coincidence processing. Coincidence or SPE events are recorded to an external disk and minimal post processing is required prior to image reconstruction. Initial imaging results from a phantom filled with (18)FDG solution and an optical pattern placed on the front end of a detector module in the vicinity of a SPE source are shown.

AB We present the development of a new fully digital, flexible, cost-efficient data acquisition system (DAQ) suitable for dual head Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners for small animal imaging applications. A free-running 12 bit octal channel Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), with 65 MHz sampling rate, was used for the digitization of the detector signals. The digitized data were fed into a Spartan 6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for event processing. An embedded system was developed for the acquisition, using Xilinx's Embedded Development Kit (EDK) and Microblaze processor. A digital version of the Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD) method was implemented in the FPGA, in order to achieve higher time resolution than the ADC sampling period, eliminating the need of an external mixed-signal device. The obtained information using FPGA includes: event timing, energy determination-discrimination, position determination and coincidence processing. The online processing of potential coincident events, significantly reduces the amount of data that will be transmitted to the computer. Coincident events are written temporarily to an external memory provided on a development board and are transferred to a Personal Computer (PC), via Ethernet link, for image reconstruction. Minimal post processing of the data is required prior to reconstruction. A small detector pair consisting of a BGO array coupled to a Position Sensitive Photomultiplier Tube (PSPMT) was used for the evaluation of the readout system. Obtained results prove that the proposed architecture can be used for the readout of dual head PET detectors for small animal imaging applications.

AB We are developing 10 mm thick CZT detectors with 3-D readout for similar to100 keV to similar to1.5 MeV gamma-rays. Multiple-site gamma-ray interactions are fully measured, i.e., the energy and 3-D position of each site are determined. Spatial resolution is 1 mm FWHM. Anode pixel readout with 1 mm pitch is used for x- and y-positions and charge drift times for z-positions. Drift time measurements are triggered by the cathode signal and end when each interaction site's charge cloud reaches an anode pixel. Post-event processing corrects for signal loss due to charge trapping and accurately determines gamma-ray energies with a goal of 1% energy resolution at 662 keV. Compton kinematic analysis can identify the initial interaction site in most cases as well as constrain the incident gamma-ray direction. Tests were made with a prototype detector, measuring 10 x 10 x 10 mm(3) and operated at 1000 V bias. The measured drift time resolution of 25 nsec FWHM at 662 keV and 60 nsec at 122 keV corresponds to z-position resolution of 0.25 and 0.60 mm FWHM, respectively. The technique is described and results of modeling and tests are presented.

AB We describe a silicon anode with integrated electronics for use in photon-counting microchannel-plate (MCP) imaging detectors. Very-large-scale integrated techniques using a 2 mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process allow a passive-anode region, which collects charge from the MCPs, to be surrounded by an active event-processing region. The anode region is made from a rectangular array of pads that are formed using the metal interconnect layers of the CMOS process. Individual pads are electrically connected to form isolated arrays of rows and columns; each row terminates at a well of one charge-coupled device (CCD) register, and each column terminates at a well of a second orthogonal CCD register. The distribution of charge within each register is used to encode the charge-cloud coordinates. A two-dimensional prototype anode was constructed with 128x80 pixels spaced at 50 mu m intervals; the anode readout rate is 31 250 Hz. Subpixel centroiding techniques can be employed to reduce the number of pixels that must be read for a given resolution. We envision a rugged, compact, low-power, and low-mass single-substrate imaging anode with a direct (x,y) digital interface. The design offers large array formats with inherent pixel linearity, orthogonality, and stability. An identified upgrade path promises orders-of-magnitude increases in speed (up to 10(6) photons s(-1)) and dynamic range, while maintaining large pixel count (> 4000x4000) and MCP pore-limited resolution (< 8 mu m).

AB Post-event rumination, the extent to which one engages in persistent, detailed, and negative thinking following social situations, serves as a risk process in the pathophysiology of social anxiety. Although a substantial body of research has assessed post-event rumination and social anxiety, this literature has produced inconsistent results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether the magnitude of the association between post-event rumination and social anxiety varied as a function of questionnaire and/or task utilized. We included all studies reporting a correlation between post-event rumination and social anxiety symptomatology. Fisher 's z correlation coefficients were calculated through random-effect meta-analyses. Results indicated a moderate association between post-event rumination and social anxiety symptomatology ( r = 0.45, p < 0.001, 95%CI [0.40 -0.50]). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated that the type of questionnaire used to assess post-event rumination ( Q = 44.36, df = 3, p < 0.001) and social anxiety ( Q = 26.44, df = 8, p < 0.001), as well as the task conducted prior to assessing post-event rumination ( Q =14.31, df = 2, p < 0.001), influenced the effect size. This study demonstrates a moderate relation between post-event rumination and social anxiety across the anxiety spectrum, illustrating the importance of treatments specifically targeting post-event rumination. Moreover, we highlight the importance of taking care when designing studies to explore relations between post-event rumination and social anxiety.

AB A photon event counting imaging detector, originally developed for astronomical applications, has been adapted for use on a low light level fluorescence microscope. It is based on a 40 mm diameter, three-microchannel plate image intensifier with a photon gain of 10(7) when operating in the photon event counting mode. The intensifier's output screen is lens coupled to a full frame progressive scan CCD camera which transfers the photon event data into a PC via a framegrabber, The image is built up from the photon events in the frames using software-based event processing. The high sensitivity of the photon counting approach means that low excitation light levels and/or a low probe concentration can be used. Moreover, the inherent linearity between incident intensity and the number of detected events provides intrinsic photometric accuracy independent of camera gain and offset.
   To demonstrate the viability of photon event counting imaging applied to fluorescence studies, we have imaged 4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran(DCM-) and rhodamine 6G-doped thin films produced by the sol-gel technique using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a precursor. We show that fluorescence imaging is a feasible tool for finding cracks, streaks or other defects and for assessing the uniform thickness of the finished films. In addition, we image the fluorescence in response to an excitation beam illuminating rhodamine 6G-doped bulk monolith sol-gel samples. The results are analysed using the Lambert-Beer law.

AB In the present study, we considered error-related brain activity in event-related potentials, to investigate the relationship between error monitoringthat is, the detection and evaluation of erroneous responsesand action effect monitoringthat is, monitoring of the sensory consequences of behavior. To this end, participants worked on a task-switching paradigm that consisted of a free-choice task, in which a puzzle piece had to be attached to an existing one (the prime task), and a subsequent color flanker task (the probe task). We examined whether unexpected action effects in the prime task would affect the subsequent error monitoring in the probe task. We found the neural correlates of error monitoring during the probe task, the error-related negativity as well as the error positivity, to be increased after unexpected action effects in the prime task. In contrast, the neural correlates of visual attention were decreased after unexpected action effects, in line with recent findings on an attenuation of sensory processing after errors. Our results demonstrate a direct link between monitoring processes in the two tasks. We propose that both error monitoring and action effect monitoring rely on a common generic monitoring system related to novelty detection or affective processing. Preactivating this system by means of unexpected action effects increases the sensitivity for detecting an error in the subsequent task.

AB D1-receptor antagonism is known to impair rodent memory but also inhibits spontaneous exploration of stimuli to be remembered. Hypo-exploration could contribute to impaired memory by influencing event processing. In order to explore this effect, the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, was administered to rats via routes that either did or did not affect spontaneous exploration: systemic or prelimbic administration, respectively. Effects were tested in spatial and non-spatial memory tasks selected for their requirements for self-initiated exploration of stimuli to be remembered in order to examine the effects on memory: cross-maze and object recognition task. Systemic administration reduced spatial exploration in cross-maze as well as in an open field test, and also reduced object exploration. Spatial (hippocampus-dependent) short-term memory was inhibited in the cross-maze and non-spatial short-term object retention was also impaired. In contrast to these systemic effects, bilateral injections of SCH23390 into the prelimbic cortices altered neither spatial nor object exploration, but did inhibit short-term memory in both cross-maze and object recognition task. Therefore, the inhibiting effects of SCH23390 on both spatial and non-spatial memory were not mediated indirectly via reduced exploration of stimuli to be remembered, but through antagonism of a prelimbic D1-R function that is directly involved in memory formation. Finally, a cooperative regulation of spatial exploration between D1-R and mGlu5 was indicated by a synergistic effect of the antagonists SCH23390 and MPEP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents the results from the analysis of an experimental investigation with the aim to provide insight to the cyclic, instantaneous heat transfer phenomena occurring in both the cylinder head and exhaust manifold wall surfaces of a direct injection (DI), air-cooled diesel engine. The mechanism of cyclic heat transfer is investigated during engine transient events, viz, after a sudden change in engine speed and/or load, both for the combustion chamber and exhaust manifold surfaces. These results are then compared with relevant experimental data from steady state operation which in the present case are used as reference helping to reveal any potential influences of each transient event on cyclic heat transfer. The experimental installation allowed both long- and short-term signal types to be recorded on a common time reference base during the transient event. Processing of experimental data was accomplished using a modified version of one-dimensional heat conduction theory with Fourier analysis, capable to cater for the special characteristics of transient engine operation. Based on this model, the evolution of local surface heat flux during a transient event was calculated. Two engine transient events are examined, which present a key difference in the way the load and speed changes are imposed on each one of them. From the analysis of experimental results it is confirmed that each thermal transient event consists of two distinguished phases the "thermodynamic" and the "structural" one which are appropriately configured and analyzed. In the case of a severe variation, in the first 20 cycles after the beginning of the transient event, the wall surface temperature amplitude on cylinder head was almost three times higher than the one observed at the "normal" temperature oscillations occurring during the steady state operation. At the same time, peak pressure values in the same cycles are increased by almost 15% above their corresponding values at the final steady state. The same phenomena are valid for the exhaust manifold surfaces but on a moderated scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
