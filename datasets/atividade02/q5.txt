J	Cabane, H; Farias, K				Cabane, Hebert; Farias, Kleinner			On the impact of event-driven architecture on performance: An exploratory study	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				Article						Event-driven architecture; Performance; Empirical study; Distributed applications; Software modularity; Monolithic application		Event-driven architecture has been widely adopted in the software industry in recent years. This adoption is motivated by the increase in software modularity, and mainly the desired performance of decomposed monolithic applications. Although it has become popular, the current literature lacks studies that demonstrate the impact of event-driven architecture on performance. Hence, developers and architects end up adopting event-driven architecture without empirical evidence, but considering "expert advice."This study, therefore, reports an empirical study on the impact of the adoption of event-driven architecture on performance. For this, the performance of an application implemented with an event-based architecture was compared with the performance of the same application implemented using a monolithic architecture. The comparison was made using metrics such as CPU usage, memory, response time, throughput, and total packages sent and received. The results, supported by statistical tests, show that the monolithic architecture, compared to the event-driven architecture, consumes less computational resources and has better response times. Finally, this study reflects on the adoption of event-driven architecture, as well as points out challenges and implications that need to be considered by the scientific community in future research.

Event-driven architecture has been considered as a promising enabler for smart manufacturing. However, in the primitive event-driven architecture all components work in parallel, and there are few frameworks or standards that deal with organizing and managing the components. This paper proposes an ontology based holonic event-driven architecture for smart manufacturing systems. Powered by the developed ontology model and Semantic Web technology, the ontology based architecture enables the distributed components in a smart manufacturing system to be configured autonomously and collaborate with each other even when they don't know much about their counterpart.

Tizen is an open source, standards-based software platform supported by leading mobile operators, device manufacturers, and silicon suppliers for multiple device categories such as smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, and smart TVs. The Tizen sensor framework before release version 3.0 supports a polling based architecture where the request for sensor events is polled from the applications. The new architecture that will be supported from Tizen 3.0 release would support an event driven architecture, where the sensor events are notified to the applications from the sensor server whenever the events become available in the server. Problems such as dropping of events and duplicate events were observed in the polling based sensor framework architecture when polled events were requested at an interval below 200 milliseconds. With mobile applications requiring an event delivery interval range between 1 millisecond and 1 second, the polling based architecture would be replaced with a new event driven architecture. The new event driven architecture has been designed and implemented to overcome the event handling issues. This paper provides insight into the two Tizen sensor framework architectures and a comparison is made based on our analysis, observations and results. With both architectures having their own advantages and disadvantages, we also look at use cases where both architectures can be used.

In the IT world of business and services, every response of business is dependent on many other related features. In the service related models, one architecture that is winning much appreciation is the Event Driven Architecture. This paper tries to study the Event Driven nature common in business systems and tries to propose a support architecture for such model from the Nano Computing Arena. The model that we propose is by incorporating the Event Driven Nature at both process and design level. Reconfigurable architectures, which are emerging areas of research, seem to be right candidates for this. The paper is an attempt to bring together the ideas of this Event oriented flow at every level of the system.

This paper presents a model-to-model transformation for this case based on UML state machines, UML class diagrams for the microservice architecture, a mathematical specification of the transformations and the implementation of the transformation with QVTo. A run-time state or workflow engine as a single-point-of-failure can be avoided with the choreographic and event-driven approach persevering the ability to generate a state machine as an additional system component that provides the advantages of a state or workflow engine features like monitoring, and visualization.

Hence in the current contribution, a framework based on event driven architecture is elaborated which can be employed to realize enterprise integration, and enhance online monitoring and control of enterprise processes. A process model is been presented that assists the introduction, configuration and implementation of the envisaged framework. The framework is composed of following components: data collection engine, data aggregation engine, process database, complex event processing engine, and process visualization clients. Finally, the framework has been validated in an industrial scenario.

Its circuit-level event-driven architecture reduces the duty cycle of power-hungry blocks, saving power while posing little performance penalty. In addition, the charge reuse technique further reduces the power consumption for the always-on detecting circuit. Implemented in a 0.18- mu m CMOS process, the 180-kHz relaxation oscillator exhibits a frequency deviation of +/- 0.26% against temperature (-40 to 125 degrees C) from Monte-Carlo simulation (N=30), leading to a low temperature coefficient of 32 ppm/degrees C. The simulated power consumption is 163 nW, resulting in power efficiency of 0.9 nW/kHz.

Similarly, mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets and laptops are widespread nowadays. Consequently, the integration of CEP into mobile computing is a natural idea. In this paper, we present MetaXA, an event-driven architecture (EDA) with CEP specifically designed for mobile devices, along with its application scenarios in mobile computing: notification distribution and theft detection. Among the main enhancements of MetaXA over previously published work are enabling CEP on mobile devices and leveraging a lightweight yet still platform-independent communication protocol (viz., XMPP). In addition, MetaXA features real-time communication patterns and a publish-subscribe mechanism. MetaXA is implemented on different mobile platforms: Android and Windows Phone.

Using microservices gives the ability of scalability and better fault tolerance. On the other hand, using microservices has some challenges, one of them is that communication between microservices must be efficient and robust. In this work, we focused on this challenge, analyzed the performance of communication techniques, and identified their advantages and disadvantages. We compared synchronous REST architecture and asynchronous event driven architecture.

From a programmer building custom packaged applications to the development of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and other business specific packages. The need for integrating different systems in the organization led to point to point interface and spaghetti architecture. Fallout of these spaghetti architectures is the development of the Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) concept. In this paper we are going to discuss about the evolution of EAI concepts and a new architecture for event driven data transformation for application integration using Web Services. The new architecture overcomes the drawback of request-reply semantics of web services by providing an event driven architecture, which supports asynchronous communication between applications using web services. We have also implemented a secure framework for accessing third party web services using message level encryption and digital certificates.

A modern manufacturing system is the one which provides the industry with flexibility to adopt to the constantly changing market demands. In order to be flexible, the manufacturing system should be able to make better use of the shop floor data. Data from the shop floor level should be available in real time to facilitate the decision making process. The process of implementation of an event driven architecture along with services in a real time production environment will be discussed in this paper. For this purpose, pedal car line at Scania Sodertalje is analyzed for the implementation of event driven architecture. The old hand held tools and controllers at the assembly stations were replaced with modern wireless power tools and the latest power focus 6000 controller. The data generated by the power tools was converted into a standard format so that it can easily be interpreted by a message broker. The messages were published on Kafka message bus where other systems were able to subscribe and consume the data. A couple of endpoints were created, one was a REST API that subscribed to the message bus and consumed the data from power tools and visualized key parameters for the operator at the shop floor in real time. Second service created was to calculate certain KPIs and visualize them in graphs form for the maintenance and production engineers. This implementation demonstrated that an event driven architecture such as LISA can be implemented on a real shop floor making real time data available to different systems. (C) 2018 The Authors.

This paper proposes a kind of software architecture for network server, AEANS, which aims at supporting Internet applications. By introducing a new thread abstraction, micro-thread, MEANS upwardly provides the micro-thread environment to programmers, and downwardly accesses the OS services concurrently through traditional thread primitives, and uses the event-driven mechanism to manage and schedule micro-threads, which takes advantage of both multithread and event-driven architecture. Moreover, MEANS is general, scalable, robust and adaptable. By preliminary evaluation, in terms of the concurrence policy, MEANS has features similar to event-driven architecture; and it outperforms multithread architecture in I/Oaccessing.

Models to predict the performance of pure EDA systems are relatively easy to make, systems with a combination of event-driven components and legacy components with blocking service requests (synchronous interactions) require special treatment. Layered queueing was developed for such systems, and this work describes a method for combining event-driven behaviour and synchronous behaviour in a layered queueing model. The performance constraints created by the legacy components can be explored to guide decisions regarding converting them, or reconfiguring them, when the system is scaled.

J	Cao, H; Yang, X; Deng, RY				Cao, Hui; Yang, Xing; Deng, Raoyi			Ontology-Based Holonic Event-Driven Architecture for Autonomous Networked Manufacturing Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				Article						Autonomous configuration; event-driven architecture (EDA); networked manufacturing system (NMS); ontology	SERVICE DISCOVERY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The current trends in personalized products drive the paradigms of production systems toward autonomous networked manufacturing systems. This article proposes an ontology-based holonic event-driven architecture for implementing loosely coupled, holonic, autonomous distributed systems. The event-driven architecture (EDA) enables the services provided by different organizations and their suborganizations to be autonomously configured and integrated, while ensuring that the predefined organizational event access rules are compulsorily followed. This is realized by organizing the event services in a holonic manager and modeling the knowledge of services via the ontology developed in this study. The ontology model and the corresponding autonomous configuration mechanism are introduced. We developed a demonstration case to elaborate our approach and implemented a testbed using Java-based technology for testing the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and reliability of the proposed approach. Note to Practitioners-The ever-changing customer demands, the volatile market, and the trend of mass personalization require manufacturing systems to be smart in the event of uncertainties. To this end, information sharing in the supply chain is a key factor. However, there are several barriers in implementing a cross-organizational information system, including security, access privileges, and system interoperability. To lift these barriers, this article proposes an ontology model and a hierarchical EDA. Compared with conventional architectures, our approach facilitates the management of access privileges, integration of interorganizational information systems, and their interoperation. Moreover, our approach is competitive compared with the conventional service-oriented architecture in terms of both scalability and reliability of the system. Before the proposed approach can be practically applied, the ontology model needs to be further extended, and the event registration and message exchange protocol need to be standardized.

The event-driven architecture therefor provides the informational solution for a smoothly integration of sensor events in the existing IT infrastructure. An exact specification of the events to be processed is essential. In this article a procedure for building an event model for production control and the basic properties of the model will be presented. In a higher abstraction layer those are the control variables of production control. On a lower level status data of production for real-time feedback is delivered by basic sensor-events and machine data logging.

A rise of event-driven architecture approach and message queue systems provide a new alternative to face this scenario evidencing the lack of quantitative measurements comparing performance and scalability between specific message queue products. This article proposes a prototype architecture applied in ZeroMQ and RabbitMQ, used for measure the impact of (1) the number of messages over performance, and (2) the numbers of consuming nodes over scalability. The results show that for both criteria, the degradation threshold of ZeroMQ is higher than RabbitMQ, thus more scalable and faster.

It lets us apply principles of the Model Driven Development (MDD) in order to create the information system which complies with the model. The proposed approach provides a set of advantages in information systems development, use and maintenance: bridges the gap between business and IT, an exact specification, which is easily to implement into information system, up-to-date documentation etc. The practical experience proves the viability of the proposed approach.

In this work, we propose an API that allows the programmer to choose and program scheduling policies in the specific setting of a staged event-driven architecture. Through the study of various scheduling policies, we have extracted common requirements and built an interface that allows developers to build and combine scheduling controllers. The implementation is specific to the Leda event-driven architecture, but the same model could be applied in other systems with similar needs. Using this interface, we have built controllers for a set of scheduling policies, and we report the results of experiments with these policies in two Leda applications with different load profiles.

J	Zuki, SZM; Mohamad, R; Saadon, NA				Zuki, Siti Zulaikha Mohd; Mohamad, Radziah; Saadon, Nor Azizah			Containerized Event-Driven Microservice Architecture	BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL				Article						Container environment; Error handling; Event-driven architecture; Event manager; Microservice		Microservice architecture offers many advantages, especially for business applications, due to its flexibility, expandability, and loosely coupled structure for ease of maintenance. However, there are several disadvantages that stem from the features of microservices, such as the fact that microservices are independent in nature can hinder meaningful communication and make data synchronization more challenging. This paper addresses the issues by proposing a containerized microservices in an asynchronous event -driven architecture. This architecture encloses microservices in containers and implements an event manager to keep track of all the events in an event log to reduce errors in the application. Experiment results show a decline in response time compared to two other benchmark architectures, as well as a lessening in error rate.

It mainly thanks to a clock-free time-shielding level-crossing ADC (TS-LCADC), software-defined clock-free multi-function detectors, and an asynchronous pipelined event-driven architecture. First, by quantifying RSE noisy signals with clock-free adaptive sampling in a signal-noise-rejecting manner, the proposed TS-LCADC reduces number of sampling points and power, and consumes only 41 nW when on-call waiting for IoT events. Second, the proposed clock-free multi-function detectors with offline and online programmability are able to character the signal features of versatile IoTs events and allow versatile and dynamic wake-up functions. Third, the proposed asynchronous pipelined event-driven architecture minimizes the system activity and thus power, because a power-hungry high-performance system (HPS) is only woken up when a detected parameter crosses its corresponding threshold. As such, the long-term average power (LTA-power) is dominated by the always-on circuits in RSE scenarios. The measurement results achieve 71-75 nW for three typical applications, i.e., heart rate, epilepsy, and keyword envelope detection. The LTA power is only 57 nW when waiting for RSE events, which is 30x lower than a prior general-purpose wake-up chip. Compared with other works of dedicated voice and acoustic wake-up functions, this work consumes 2x and 17x less power, respectively, while featuring 16x higher signal bandwidth and a broader versatility.

Service Orchestration engines, also named BPEL engines, are in charge Of executing and managing the workflow specified ill BPEL. As a kind of server application, high performance under massive concurrency is necessary to design a scalable BPEL engine, and it is a challenging problem to implement it correct and highly concurrent BPEL engine. We propose all approach based oil event-driven architecture to design BPEL engine and introduce the FSM (finite state machines) to describe the semantics of the BPEL process. We also test our BPEL engine and prove the improvement in capability of handling the massive concurrency comparing to the one based on the thread-based concurrent paradigm.

TBED endows the real-time local monitoring along with spatial monitoring. None of the work till now considers both local and spatial monitoring. To the best of our knowledge, TBED is the first attempt in this domain, where event-related information is reported to the consumers along with the effective area. TBED is based on the event-driven architecture in which device management and monitoring authorities, middleware event handler (MEH), and consumers are involved. Additionally, we present a trust mechanism to evaluate the sensor node trust for reliable information. At last, we present a case study of fire monitoring to depict the real-life scenario.

Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) supports request reply pattern, it not suits for the stop- start (asynchronous) communication. Therefore, in this paper we integrate the SOA with the Event Driven Architecture (EDA) in web service discovery. The critical problem of service discovery in application-oriented web service technologies is how to match the user request with the web service advertisement, efficiently and accurately as per the user requirements. To meliorate the accuracy and efficiency in WS-discovery, the Proficient Matchmaking Technique (PMT) has been proposed in EDSOA. The performance evaluation shows that performance of the proposed technique is aloft than the existing technique.	[Dharanyadevi, P.; Dhavachelvan, P.; Jayakumar, S. K.

To make an operational impact, however, these technologies and solutions must be linked to the relevant data sources and tailored to the operator needs in the Space Command and Control and Space Situational Awareness mission areas. Therefore we propose a holistic, mission-driven approach for data integration, with three key tenets to address industry challenges: Net-Centric data exposure and access through well-defined SOA web service interfaces Push-pull data integration based on an Event-Driven Architecture Augmented data understanding through mission-driven capability analysis The centerpiece of the framework is an Event-Driven Data Integration Environment (EDDIE) that serves as a broker between mission-specific data needs and various data providers. Leveraging the emerging Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technologies, this layer provides a combination of on-demand "pull" of relevant information by an end user and the event-driven "push" of time-sensitive information to support decision making. Architecturally, this loosely-coupled framework is based on Net-Centric tenets and industry/DoD standards, allowing new tools and data sources to be ingested and evolve over time. The results of the event driven architecture framework enable the required C2 performance thresholds and objectives as well as a repeatable integration structure.'

Intelligent Sleep Monitoring System Based on Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture	IEEE ACCESS				Article						Monitoring; Sleep; Classification algorithms; Microservice architectures; Electrocardiography; Databases; Cloud computing; Event-driven architecture; extreme learning machine; Internet of Things; microservices; sleep monitoring	STAGES CLASSIFICATION; RESOURCE	Sleep monitoring using polysomnography (PSG) in hospitals can be considered expensive, so the preferable way is to use contactless and wearable sensors to monitor sleep daily by patients at home. In this study, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform was utilized for sleep monitoring with contactless or wearable sensors as an integrated system developed based on an event-driven and microservice architecture. Multiple services that respond to events are provided within the system. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data were used as the input in the sleep monitoring system. The combination of the weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to process the ECG data, followed by fuzzy logic to measure sleep quality, then display the data on the dashboard. Based on the experimental results, the proposed architecture increased throughput by 34.76%, decreased response time by 55.85%, and reduced memory consumption by 37.26% per instance replication compared to the non-event-driven architecture. The accuracies of the sleep stage classification were 78.78% and 73.09% for the three and four classes, respectively, and the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reached 0.89 for both the three and four class classifications.

This paper proposes a spatio-temporal event model for unmanned swarms to provide support for stable operation and rapid response. First, based on the analysis of the collaboration problems in unmanned swarms, the collaboration relationship between unmanned cluster tasks is summarized according to graph theory. Then, we dame and describe the spatio-temporal events for unmanned swarms, and obtain 3 temporal primitives and 6 spatial primitives according to the temporal relationship and spatial topological relationship. Finally, design an event-driven architecture that uses event triggering, heartbeat mechanism, and active inquiry methods to ensure the unmanned cluster system's consistency and fault tolerance on the basis of satisfying the rapid response of the unmanned system swarm.

The proposed architecture incorporates the biosensors and a gateway that synchronises, secures and connects the traffic with the back-end infrastructure. This infrastructure is in turn composed of numerous services that are responsible for acquiring, storing and classifying the synchronised data. It has been chosen to integrate two non-invasive devices in a first version of the architecture. These are an electrocardiogram sensor and a wearable device that monitors electrodermal activity, blood volume pressure, time between heartbeats, skin surface temperature and acceleration. Tests have shown that the proposed approach improves synchronisation times using the edge compared to direct data delivery to the cloud.

J	Mariani, S; Omicini, A				Mariani, Stefano; Omicini, Andrea			Coordinating activities and change: An event-driven architecture for situated MAS	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				Article						MAS architecture; Event-driven model; Situatedness; Coordination; Middleware; TuCSoN	AGENT; ENVIRONMENTS; MODEL	Agent activities and environment change are what make things happen in a multi-agent system (MAS). Complexity in a MAS comes from non-trivial dependencies between activities (social interaction), and between activities and environment change (situated interaction). As they are used to manage social (agent-agent) dependencies, coordination artefacts could also be used to govern situated (agent-environment) dependencies. Along this line, in this paper we propose an event-driven architecture for complex MAS that exploits coordination to handle all sorts of dependencies in a uniform way. We first motivate the underlying meta-model and put some well-known agent-based frameworks in perspective, then we discuss its general articulation along with its reification within the TuCSoN coordination middleware.

The paper commences with a brief overview of the relevant theoretical and implementational concepts, such as the event-driven architecture, Event Sourcing, CQRS, distributed logs and concurrency control. The following part of the paper presents the two proposed approaches: the first uses the Apache Kafka Streams API and the second uses the Microsoft Service Fabric Actor Services. The final part of the paper is devoted to the capabilities of the of the two approaches, focusing on the following aspects: communication mechanism, querying support, scalability, backpressure, and improvement potential.

To protect computers from the ever-increasing threat of intrusion, we propose an event-driven architecture that provides fine grained intrusion detection and decision support capability. Within this architecture, an incoming event is scrutinized by the Subject-Verb-Object multipoint monitors. Deviations from normal behavior detected by SVO monitors will trigger different alarms, which are sent to subsequent fusion and verification modules to reduce the false positive rate. The system then performs impact analysis by studying real-time system metrics, collected through the Windows Management Instrumentation interface. We add to the system the capability to assist the administrator in taking effective actions to mitigate the aftermath of an intrusion.

The crisis cell must reach for new, external, data sources. However, new data lead to new issues: their volume, veracity, variety or velocity cannot be managed by humans only, especially under high stress and time pressure. This paper proposes (i) a framework to enhance situation awareness while managing the 5Vs of Big Data, (ii) general principles to be followed and (iii) a new architecture implementing the proposed framework. The latter merges event-driven and model-driven architectures. It has been tested on a realistic flood scenario set up by official French services.

It is unclear in which information source an event is reported first and, information from various sources can be complementing. Thus, it is important to search for information in a very broad range of sources. Furthermore, real-time processing is necessary to deal with the huge amounts of incoming data in time. Event-driven architectures are designed to address such challenges. This will be shown in this paper by presenting the architecture of a public health surveillance system that follows this style. Starting from concrete user requirements and scenarios, we introduce the architecture with its components for content collection, data analysis and integration. The system will allow for the monitoring of events in real-time as well as retrospectively.

WSDL and BPEL extensions for Event Driven Architecture	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY				Article						Event; EDA (Event Driven Architecture); SOA (Service Oriented Architecture); WSPA (Web Services Platform Architecture); BPEL (Business Process Execution Language); WSDL (Web Service Description Language)	WEB SERVICE COMPOSITION	Context: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event Driven Architecture (EDA) are two acknowledged architectures for the development of business applications and information systems, which have evolved separately over the years. Objective: This paper proposes a solution for extending the SOA/Web Services Platform Architecture (WSPA) with support for business events and EDA concepts. Our solution enables services to act as event producers and event consumers. It also enables event-driven service orchestrations in business processes. Method: Based on a comparison of SOA and EDA, we have identified and designed the required extensions to enable support for events and event-driven process orchestration in WSPA. Results: We propose specific extensions to WSDL and BPEL, and a flexible XML representation of the event payload data. We introduce event sinks, sources, and triggers to WSDL. We extend BPEL with new activities to trigger and catch events, and extend fault and event handlers, variables, and correlation properties to accommodate events. Conclusion: As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype implementation and assessed the extensions on three pilot projects. We have shown that our proposed extensions work on real projects and that combining event-driven and service-oriented semantics makes sense in many business applications and can considerably reduce the development effort.

It can satisfy the demand of loose couple communication and cooperation in the enterprise applications. However, existing ESB based systems can't process the complex events in the real-world applications very well. In this paper, we firstly give a complex event processing model based on the relational algebra, and then propose a complex event processing oriented enterprise service bus platform and a complex event stream processing engine, and give the main algorithms of complex event processing and their performance analysis. Experiments show that our platform performs much better than the existing ESB based systems in complex event processing.

From a programmer building custom packaged applications to the development of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and other business specific packages. The need for integrating different systems in the organization led to point to point interface and spaghetti architecture. Fallout of these spaghetti architectures is the development of the Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) concept. In this paper we are going to discuss the evolution of EAI concepts and a new architecture for event driven data transformation for application integration using Web Services. The new architecture overcomes the drawback of request-reply semantics of web services by providing an event driven architecture, which supports asynchronous communication between applications using web services. We have also implemented a secure framework for accessing third party web services using message level encryption and digital certificates.

For their primary usage as communication vehicles, mobile devices have surpassed any other mediums. But mobile devices come with a high price - interruptions anywhere, anytime. Due to untimely interruptions, employees experience negative emotions, leading to a loss of productivity. With the emergence of mobile device management (MDM) systems, the number of interruptions employees experience on a daily basis can grow rapidly. However, interruption management has gained no attention in the area of MDM systems. As an attempt to fill a gap in this area, we build an event-driven architecture to integrate interruption management into MDM systems, without exhausting the limited resources of mobile devices, which are typically battery life, processing power and network bandwidth.

Node.js provides an effective asynchronous event-driven programming model, and supports asynchronous tasks and multi-priority event queues. Unexpected races among events and asynchronous tasks can cause severe consequences. Existing race detection approaches in Node.js applications mainly adopt random fuzzing technique, and can miss races due to large schedule space. In this paper, we propose a dynamic race detection approach NRace for Node.js applications. In NRace, we build precise happens-before relations among events and asynchronous tasks in Node.js applications, which also take multi-priority event queues into consideration. We further develop a predictive race detection technique based on these relations. We evaluate NRace on 10 real-world Node.js applications. The experimental result shows that NRace can precisely detect 6 races, and 5 of them have been confirmed by developers.

A parts agent leads the promotion of processes in this type of assembly system. First, product agents create the assembly process model that contains the assembly sequence to complete the product. Next, product agents generate parts agents that have the assembly process model. Parts agents will be assembled by machines, with some communications between other agents. The proposed system is defined as an event driven architecture. The increase in the costs of communication between agents is polynomial in the number of the agents.

Conventional software architectures do not explicitly target the efficient processing of continuous event streams. Recently, event-driven architectures (EDA) have been proposed as a new paradigm for event-based applications. In this paper we propose a reference architecture for event-driven traffic management systems, which enables the analysis and processing of complex event streams in real-time and is therefore well-suited for decision support in sensor-based traffic control systems. We will illustrate our approach in the domain of road traffic management. In particular, we will report on the redesign of an intelligent transportation management system (ITMS) prototype for the high-capacity road network in Bilbao, Spain. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A Cooperative Approach to Traffic Congestion Detection With Complex Event Processing and VANET	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				Article						Complex event processing (CEP); event-driven architecture (EDA); traffic information systems (TISs); vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)		Currently, distributed traffic information systems have come up as one of the most important approaches for detecting traffic flow problems on a road. For that purpose, they usually make use of the location information that vehicles share among them through periodical messages that are transmitted across a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). This paper puts forward an event-driven architecture (EDA) as a novel mechanism to get insight into VANET messages to detect different levels of traffic jams; furthermore, it also takes into account environmental data that come from external data sources, such as weather conditions. The proposed EDA has been developed through the complex-event-processing technology. Simulation tests show that the proposed mechanism can detect traffic congestions, which involve different numbers of lanes and lengths with short delay.
