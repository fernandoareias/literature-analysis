Intelligent Sleep Monitoring System Based on Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture	IEEE ACCESS				Article						Monitoring; Sleep; Classification algorithms; Microservice architectures; Electrocardiography; Databases; Cloud computing; Event-driven architecture; extreme learning machine; Internet of Things; microservices; sleep monitoring	STAGES CLASSIFICATION; RESOURCE	Sleep monitoring using polysomnography (PSG) in hospitals can be considered expensive, so the preferable way is to use contactless and wearable sensors to monitor sleep daily by patients at home. In this study, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform was utilized for sleep monitoring with contactless or wearable sensors as an integrated system developed based on an event-driven and microservice architecture. Multiple services that respond to events are provided within the system. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data were used as the input in the sleep monitoring system. The combination of the weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to process the ECG data, followed by fuzzy logic to measure sleep quality, then display the data on the dashboard. Based on the experimental results, the proposed architecture increased throughput by 34.76%, decreased response time by 55.85%, and reduced memory consumption by 37.26% per instance replication compared to the non-event-driven architecture. The accuracies of the sleep stage classification were 78.78% and 73.09% for the three and four classes, respectively, and the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reached 0.89 for both the three and four class classifications.

As the data size managed by MapReduce applications is steadily increasing, the need for improving the Hadoop performance also grows. Existing modifications of Hadoop (e.g., Mellanox Unstructured Data Accelerator) attempt to improve performance by changing some of its underlying subsystems. However, they are not always capable to cope with all its performance bottlenecks or they hinder its portability. Furthermore, new frameworks like Apache Spark or DataMPI can achieve good performance improvements, but they do not keep compatibility with existing MapReduce applications. This paper proposes Flame-MR, a new event-driven MapReduce architecture that increases Hadoop performance by avoiding memory copies and pipelining data movements, without modifying the source code of the applications. The performance evaluation on two representative systems (an HPC cluster and a public cloud platform) has shown experimental evidence of significant performance increases, reducing the execution time by up to 54% on the Amazon EC2 cloud.

To design this type of application, event driven architecture (EDA) is used to develop distributed, scalable, decoupled, desynchronized and real-time components. The interconnection between the different components is done through event brokers that allow communication based on messages (events). Although the design of the components is independent of the environment in which they are deployed, this environment can determine the infrastructure to be used, for example the event brokers, so it is common to have to make modifications to the applications to adapt them to these environments, which complicates their design and maintenance. It is therefore necessary to have an event mesh that allows the connection between event brokers to simplify the development of applications. This paper presents the SCIFI-II system, an event mesh that allows the distribution of events between event brokers. Its use will allow the design of components decoupling them from the event brokers, which will facilitate their deployment in any environment.

One common aim is to provide systems able to synchronize these devices, handle the big amount of daily generated data and meet business demands. This paper proposes a cost-effective cloud-based architecture using an event-driven backbone to process many applications' data in real-time, called REDA. It supports the Amazon Web Service (AWS) IoT core, and it opens the door as a free software-based implementation. Measured data from several wireless sensor nodes are transmitted to the cloud running application through the lightweight publisher/subscriber messaging transport protocol, MQTT. The real-time stream processing platform, Apache Kafka, is used as a message broker to receive data from the producer and forward it to the correspondent consumer. Micro-services design patterns, as an event consumer, are implemented with Java spring and managed with Apache Maven to avoid the monolithic applications' problem. The Apache Kafka cluster co-located with Zookeeper is deployed over three availability zones and optimized for high throughput and low latency. To guarantee no message loss and to simulate the system performances, different load tests are carried out. The proposed architecture is reliable in stress cases and can handle records goes to 8000 messages in a second with low latency in a cheap hosted and configured architecture.

This fact increasingly highlights the importance of designing real-time and intelligent CPSs that are capable of decision making. In this paper, an Intelligent Architecture model for CPS management (IA-CPS) based on online processing is proposed for this purpose. Specifically, it can manage simple and complex events based on a service-oriented architecture and directed by an event-driven architecture, using event processing technology as Complex Event Processing (CEP). The novelty of our approach relies on the fact that the proposed architecture is service-oriented, which models the functionalities of the event-driven system. This gives us the possibility to offer a flexible service catalog, allowing us to connect to the system on any kind of device and interact in different scenarios. The model has been applied to two use cases: processing images from video surveillance cameras, and processing of consumption data captured by water and energy sensors installed in end-user environments.

At the same time, developing distributed systems is still complex and difficult. In order to reduce the complexity in distributed application development, a series of techniques such as RPC, message-oriented middleware have been proposed and widely used. These techniques hide the underlying communicating details but require developers to take control of coordination among different machines for complex distributed tasks. This paper proposes a lightweight event-driven framework called DistGear to simplify the development of complex task processing in distributed applications. DistGear is a layer of software built on top of communication facilities for providing developers with a programming abstraction to easily handle distributed tasks and control machine coordination in tasks. We implement DistGear based on coroutines and message communication. Experience with DistGear in a simplified real-world system suggests it is effective. Performance evaluation also demonstrates DistGear's good concurrency and low resources consumption.

Many well-known companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and IBM has built their own clouds in addition to many other open source cloud computing platforms and frameworks. There are many characteristics which a cloud should have. Many of the existing platforms and frameworks lack of some of these characteristics, for example most of them cannot really be integrated, all of them just give the user some tools and platforms (such as service bus and development kits), but there is no provided intelligence and automation. This paper proposes a framework that supports all of the mentioned characteristics and some others like low coupling and high integration. The proposed framework not only supports traditional cloud facilities, but using a service, adds intelligence to cloud to provide an automatic environment. To achieve the above mentioned goals, we have founded our framework on SOA (service oriented architecture) that manages data flow with an event driven approach.

A container-based cloud-native architecture for the reproducible execution of multi-population optimization algorithms	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				Article						Multi-population; Nature-inspired algorithm; Parallel genetic algorithms; Cloud-computing; Event-driven architecture	BEE COLONY ALGORITHM; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS	Splitting a population into multiple instances is a technique used extensively in recent years to help improve the performance of nature-inspired optimization algorithms. Work on those populations can be done in parallel, and they can interact asynchronously, a fact that can be leveraged to create scalable implementations based on, among other methods, distributed, multi-threaded, parallel, and cloud-native computing. However, the design of these cloud-native, distributed, multi-population algorithms is not a trivial task. Using as a foundation monolithic (single-instance) solutions, adaptations at several levels, from the algorithmic to the functional, must be made to leverage the scalability, elasticity, (limited) fault-tolerance, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud systems while, at the same time, conserving the intended functionality. Instead of an evolutive approach, in this paper, we propose a cloud-native optimization framework created from scratch, that can include multiple (population-based) algorithms without increasing the number of parameters that need tuning. This solution goes beyond the current state of the art, since it can support different algorithms at the same time, work asynchronously, and also be readily deployable to any cloud platform. We evaluate this solution's performance and scalability, together with the effect other design parameters had on it, particularly the number and the size of populations with respect to problem size. The implemented platform is an excellent alternative for running locally or in the cloud, thus proving that cloud-native bioinspired algorithms perform better in their "natural" environment than other algorithms, and set a new baseline for scaling and performance of this kind of algorithms in the cloud.

The advent of cloud computing (CC) and Internet of Things (IoT) adds the relevant information and events capture issue, transfer, storage, processing and sharing. Also, for a better collaboration and interoperability enhancement in supply chain, it is interesting to notify automatically each event related to logistic flows to involved actors.

J	Sfaxi, L; Ben Aissa, MM				Sfaxi, Lilia; Ben Aissa, Mohamed Mehdi			Babel: A Generic Benchmarking Platform for Big Data Architectures	BIG DATA RESEARCH				Article						Benchmark; Big Data architectures; Performance analysis; Event-driven systems; Cloud computing; Distributed systems	SYSTEMS	In this era of big and fast data, software architects tend to find it really hard to make consistent decisions about which architecture and technologies are ideal for a certain business need. It is even harder to make them while dealing with the scarcity of clear methodologies, best practices and reference architectures. In this prospect, architecture evaluation through benchmarking can be of great interest, as it enables the detection of performance anomalies or bottlenecks as you go. The problem when talking about Big Data benchmarking, is that existing solutions remain technology-related, and do not deal with the heterogeneous aspect of complex architectures. In addition to that, businesses are in general dealing with multi-layered complex systems, involving various technologies, paradigms and micro-architectures. This means that the benchmarking solution must be able to give fine-grained insights about each of the layers. A successful benchmarking system must also be seamless, easy to use, scalable, and preferably cloud native. To satisfy these requirements, we designed and implemented Babel, a generic Big Data benchmarking platform, that insures an end-to-end performance evaluation and monitoring. We present in this paper the principles, architecture, integration and deployment steps of Babel. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To improve resource utilization, the cloud resource management system could suspend/migrate some running jobs/virtual machines in order to reserve resources for other ones. While the cost of moving the whole virtual machines is too high due to the big size of virtual machines, application level migration is a possible solution. We are interested in using checkpointing and recovery technique (C&R) to stop and restart running programs on virtual machines. The paper introduces the event-based checkpointing tool (EBC), in which users can easily checkpoint and restart running programs in cloud systems. EBC is based on event-driven architecture and supports both sequential and parallel programs like MPI programs. EBC is a useful tool supporting migration as well as scheduling in cloud systems.

The first part of the paper shows these architectures and the way they fit to e-learning systems. The second part describes the main technologies that are used for developing such systems, while the third part is dedicated to e-learning databases. Finally, the last section takes an overview of the specialized e-learning functionalities that cloud computing brings. In this paper we clarify why cloud computing isn't a simple user-client architecture, why the security reaches a high level in cloud computing and why it is so important to keep all the users' needs in a pool of resource data. An important part of the paper is where we deal with cloud computing weaknesses and how they affect the e-learning process. The main problems are the internet access, students and professors' data that is kept on suppliers' servers. Overall one should be able to distinguish an authentic cloud computing e-learning system by its functionalities, availability, portability and, of course, interface. E-learning systems use all the advantages of a cloud computing architecture: the infrastructure, the platform and the services, and the paper details all these components that lead to a cloud e-learning architecture. The characteristics of a e-learning system in cloud may differ depending on the type of cloud architecture: public, private or hybrid. Moreover, from this point the philosophy and the implementation of the system take different turns.

The inherent characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency of serverless computing, attracted many companies to migrate their legacy applications toward this paradigm. However, the stateless nature of serverless requires careful migration planning, consideration of its subsequent implications, and potential challenges. To this end, this study investigates the intentions, strategies, and technical and organizational challenges while migrating to a serverless architecture. We investigated the migration processes of 11 systems across diverse domains by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with professionals from 11 organizations. We also presented a detailed discussion of each migration case. Our findings reveal that large enterprises primarily migrate to enhance scalability and operational efficiency, while smaller organizations intend to reduce the cost. Furthermore, organizations use a domain-driven design approach to identify the use case and gradually migrate to serverless using a strangler pattern. However, migration encounters technical challenges i.e., testing event-driven architecture, integrating with the legacy system, lack of standardization, and organizational challenges i.e., mindset change and hiring skilled serverless developers as a prominent. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding that can guide future implementations and advancements in the context of serverless migration.

The structure, comprised of fully autonomous cars, covers arbitrary urban areas and operates without prior reservations. Specifically developed control algorithms based on Optimization, Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence optimize the system management for any demand level and geometry. Due to V2V, V2I and V2C connectivity a fast and secure information update is achieved. Well-adapted itineraries considering customer preferences are dynamically defined. Idle vehicles are controlled and travel durations are reduced. Adequate use of the available vehicle capacity allows an important reduction of the costs for both cars and users. A comparative study with a self-service manually driven car scheme is also introduced. Qualitative and quantitative measurements appraise the system perfomance.The presented micro transit scheme in association with innovative technology (UV light sanitizing cars) could form a successful and affordable alternative for all involved entities commuters, traffic and environment under pandemic crisis where mass public transport operators increase traveller risks.

FLAS: A combination of proactive and reactive auto-scaling architecture for distributed services	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				Article						Cloud; Elasticity; Automatic scaling; Distributed systems		Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a content-based publish-subscribe middle ware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.
