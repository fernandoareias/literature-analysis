J	Kazanavicius, J; Mazeika, D				Kazanavicius, Justas; Mazeika, Dalius			EVALUATION OF MICROSERVICE COMMUNICATION WHILE DECOMPOSING MONOLITHS	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS				Article						Microservice communication; cloud computing; software engineering; HTTP rest; RabbitMQ; Kafka; gRPC; GraphQL		One of the biggest challenges while migrating from a monolith architecture to a microservice architecture is to define a proper communication technology. In monolith applications, communication between components is performed using the in-process method or function calls, while different communication methods have to be established to achieve the same functionality in a microservice architecture. A microservices-based application is a distributed system running on multiple processes or services. Therefore, microservices must interact using interprocess communication technologies. This research aims to evaluate synchronous and asynchronous communication technologies and determine particular cases for their application while decomposing monolith into cloud-native applications. Five communication technologies, such as HTTP Rest, RabbitMQ, Kafka, gRPC, and GraphQL, have been evaluated and compared by proposed evaluation criteria. The advantages and disadvantages of each communication technology were identified in the context of microservices architecture.

The use of cloud computing together with a proven big data software architecture helps reducing project costs, development time and abstracts the complexity of the underlying implementation technologies. The combination of cloud computing and big data platforms results in a new service model, called Big Data as a Service (BDaaS), that automates the process of provisioning the infrastructure. This paper presents an architecture for big data systems in private clouds, using a real system to evaluate the functionalities. The architecture supports batch/real-time processing, messaging systems and data services based on web APIs. The architectural description defines the technology roadmap, composed exclusively of big data tools. The results showed that the proposed architecture supports the facilities of cloud computing and performs well in the analysis of large datasets.

J	Kim, Y; Park, J				Kim, Youngjong; Park, Jinho			Hybrid decentralized PBFT Blockchain Framework for OpenStack message queue	HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES				Article						Cloud; OpenStack; Message queue; Hybrid; Decentralization; PBFT Blockchain		Cloud computing based on OpenStack is widely used as a distributed computing platform. OpenStack has progressed at a rapid pace, incorporating a variety of service modules; it is supported by many companies, has a community of active developers, and a diverse user base. OpenStack uses message queue to coordinate and exchange operation and status information between services. OpenStack supports various message queue services including RabbitMQ, Qpid, and ZeroMQ, whereas its distribution architecture uses RabbitMQ. As an OpenStack's message queue service, RabbitMQ runs on a controller node as a centralized service. In case of the centralized service, increased usage may cause slowed response times and security vulnerability. This paper proposes a Hybrid decentralized Practical byzantine fault tolerance Blockchain Framework with two-step verification for OpenStack message queue service. When compared to existing OpenStack message queue service, OpenStack with the proposed framework demonstrates identical reliability a faster response time by approximately 46.75% with a two-step verification process and decentralization approach. Additionally, a reduction in the security vulnerability in the OpenStack message queue information with saving the message queue information into each node by blockchain-based decentralized data duplication approach.

This cross-platform and cross-organizational image registry bridges gaps between execution environment platforms and user communities. The presented concept consists of a conceptual architecture and a sophisticated set of metadata fields to describe images as virtual environments. The main challenge is the wide spread definition of an image. The terminology defines execution environments, which consist of runtime technologies (virtual machines, containers, applications) and a management layer (basic management, cloud computing, container clusters, job schedulers). An execution environment runs a deployable implicit or declarative image to build a virtual environment. With this abstraction the image registry can share virtual environment across Cloud computing, HPC, classroom setups, with any of KVM, Docker, Singularity, etc. in use. The open source implementation is written in Go and presented with a scalable microservice architecture, using Couchbase as metadata store and RabbitMQ as communication hub between software components.

This paper proposes a Cloud-Edge data processing architecture covering both real-time and batch processing models. We design our solution as a general architecture and propose an implementation schema using RabbitMQ as a queuing engine. Two use-cases are considered: one refers to monitoring a forest and the other consider water monitoring and management. Those scenarios include both batch and real-time processing components and they can be mapped on the proposed architecture. We describe a methodology for performance evaluation and give experimental results for using RabbitMQ in a Set-Top Box environment. Using Docker containers with limited resources, we obtained a message rate of 4k messages per second for 1KB sized messages.

We explore the usability and potential development benefits of three popular open-source serverless platforms in the context of IoT: OpenFaaS, Fission, and OpenWhisk. To address this we discuss our experience developing a serverless and low-latency Distributed Deep Neural Network (DDNN) application. Our findings indicate that these serverless platforms require significant resources to operate and are not ideal for constrained devices. In addition, we archived a 55% improvement compared to Kafka-ML's performance under load, a framework without dynamic scaling support, demonstrating the potential of serverless computing for low-latency applications.

J	Nam, J; Jun, Y; Choi, M				Nam, Jaekyung; Jun, Youngpyo; Choi, Min			High Performance IoT Cloud Computing Framework Using Pub/Sub Techniques	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL				Article						cloud computing; pub; sub; IoT; MQTT; Kafka		The Internet of Things is attracting attention as a solution to rural sustainability crises, such as slowing income, exports, and growth rates due to the aging of industries. To develop a high-performance IoT platform, we designed and implemented an IoT cloud platform using pub/sub technologies. This design reduces the difficulty of overhead for management and communication, despite the harsh IoT environment. In this study, we achieved high performance by applying the pub/sub platform with two different characteristics. As the size and frequency of data acquired from IoT nodes increase, we improved performance through MQTT and Kafka protocols and multiple server architecture. MQTT was applied for fast processing of small data, and Kafka was applied for reliable processing of large data. We also mounted various sensors and actuators to measure the data of growth for each device using the protocol. For example, DHT11, MAX30102, WK-ADB-K07-19, SG-90, and so on. As a result of performance evaluation, the MQTT Kafka platform implemented in this research was found to be effective for use in environments where network bandwidth is limited or a large amount of data is continuously transmitted and received. We realized the performance as follows: the response time for user requests was measured to be within 100 ms on average, data transmission order verification for more than 13 million requests, data processing performance per second on an average of 113,134.89 record/s, and 64,313 requests per second were performed for requests that occurred simultaneously from multiple clients.

J	Torres, DR; Martín, C; Rubio, B; Díaz, M				Torres, Daniel R.; Martin, Cristian; Rubio, Bartolome; Diaz, Manuel			An open source framework based on Kafka-ML for Distributed DNN inference over the Cloud-to-Things continuum	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE				Article						Distributed deep neural networks; Cloud computing; Fog; edge computing; Distributed processing; Low-latency fault-tolerant framework	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; IOT	The current dependency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems on Cloud computing implies higher transmission latency and bandwidth consumption. Moreover, it challenges the real-time monitoring of physical objects, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT). Edge systems bring computing closer to end devices and support time sensitive applications. However, Edge systems struggle with state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNN) due to computational resource limitations. This paper proposes a technology framework that combines the Edge-Cloud architecture concept with BranchyNet advantages to support fault-tolerant and low-latency AI predictions. The implementation and evaluation of this framework allow assessing the benefits of running Distributed DNN (DDNN) in the Cloud-to-Things continuum. Compared to a Cloud-only deployment, the results obtained show an improvement of 45.34% in the response time. Furthermore, this proposal presents an extension for Kafka-ML that reduces rigidness over the Cloud-to-Things continuum managing and deploying DDNN.

The huge amount of data generated by things must be analysed with models and technologies of the "Big Data Analytics", deployed on cloud platforms. The CIRUS project aims to deliver a generic and elastic cloud-based framework for Ubilytics (ubiquitous big data analytics). The CIRUS framework collects and analyses IoT data for Machine to Machine services using Component-off-the-Shelves (COTS) such as IoT gateways, Message brokers or Message-as-a-Service providers and big data analytics platforms deployed and reconfigured dynamically with Roboconf. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the genericity and elasticity of CIRUS with the deployment of a Ubilytics use case using a real dataset based on records originating from a practical source.

This study combines big-data technology and machine learning (ML) to investigate the application of big-data analysis and cloud-computing technology in network security. First, the data-collection technology of abnormal network behavior is introduced, and the Flume data-collection component and Kafka distributed technology are discussed. Second, the data-processing process of abnormal network behavior and the corresponding algorithm processing are analyzed. Finally, an abnormal network behavior detection model based on big data is constructed and compared with related models based on decision-tree and random-forest (RF) algorithms. The experimental results show that the big-data anomalous network behavior detection technology based on the ML framework can effectively improve the type and efficiency of anomalous network behavior detection, which is of some significance for improving the network security control capability.

While widely adopted, development for the cloud has some intrinsic properties to it, making it complex to any newcomer. This research is capturing those intricacies using a pattern catalog, with this paper contributing with three of those patterns: MESSAGING SYSTEM, a message bus for abstracting service placement in a cluster and orchestrating messages between multiple services; PREEMPTIVE LOGGING, a design principle where services and servers continuously output relevant information to log files, making them available for later debugging failures; and LOG AGGREGATION, a technique to aggregate logs from multiple services and servers in a centralized location, which indexes and provides them in a queryable, user friendly format. These patterns are useful for anyone designing software for the cloud, either to guide or validate their design decisions.

We present a public method for such tracking, with the end goal of studying the interactions among Web servers. The outcome of this study could lead to building partnerships among Web servers, and used for deciding on the particular services to be offered by cloud servers. For proof of concept, we implemented a prototype in Java, and used a message broker to provide inter-server communication.

Big Data Processing is involved in our daily life such as mobile devices, RFID and wireless sensors, which aims at dealing with billions of users' interactive data. At the same time, real-time processing is eagerly needed in integrated system. In this paper, several technologies associated with real-time big data processing are introduced, among which the core technology called Storm is emphasized. An entire system is built based on Storm, associated with RabbitMQ, NoSQL and JSP. To ensure the practical applicability and high efficiency, a simulation system is established and shows acceptable performance in various expressions using data sheet and Ganglia. It is proved that the big data real-time processing based on Storm can be widely used in various computing environment.

Hence, Artificial Intelligence (AI) continuously evolves, improving life quality and business and academic activities. Kafka-ML is an open-source framework that focuses on managing Machine Learning (ML) and AI pipelines through data streams in production scenarios. Consequently, it facilitates Deep Neural Network (DNN) deployments in real-world applications. However, this framework does not consider the distribution of DNN models on the Cloud-to-Things Continuum. Distributed DNN significantly reduces latency, allocating the computational and network load between different infrastructures. In this work, we have extended our Kafka-ML framework to support the management and deployment of Distributed DNN throughout the Cloud-to-Things Continuum. Moreover, we have considered the possibility of including early exits in the Cloud-to-Things layers to provide immediate responses upon predictions. We have evaluated these new features by adapting and deploying the DNN model AlexNet in three different Cloud-to-Things scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that Kafka-ML can significantly improve response time and throughput by distributing DNN models throughout the Cloud-to-Things Continuum, compared to a Cloud-only deployment.

However, it is difficult to perform real-time large data processing in clouds due to the computational complexity of the analysis because efficient deployment schemes of streaming computing components over cloud resources have not been well-investigated. In this study, we propose a video analysis framework that collects videos from multiple cameras and analyzes them using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming. We first investigate the data transfer performance of Apache Kafka and examine efficient cluster configuration and parameter settings. We then apply this configuration to the proposed framework and measure the data analysis throughput. The experimental results show that the overall throughput varies depending on the number of broker nodes that store data, the number of topic partitions of data, and the number of nodes that conduct analysis processing. In addition, it is confirmed that the number of cores is needed to consider for the efficient cluster configuration, and that the network bandwidth between the nodes becomes a bottleneck as the amount of data and the number of components increase.

The problem that restricts robot developers in current cloud robot research is the lack of a safe way to transmit messages between edge and cloud. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the RCC (Robot Cloud Communication), a Python-based software library, which can help swarm intelligence robots data to be efficiently and securely transferred to different types of business clouds or private cloud platforms. In addition, we integrate the RCC function library and can also provide high-quality data security guarantees for development users when sending and receiving data. Through our approach, we successfully implemented the development of an indoor 3D map application which is difficult to achieve on a single robot platform. Our experimental results show that our RCC is not only very stable in performance of reading and writing, but also shows great performance in data encryption and decryption.

Scalable Big Data Pipeline for Video Stream Analytics Over Commodity Hardware	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS				Article						Video Analytics; Big Data; Data Pipeline; Spark; Kafka; OpenCV		A huge amount of data in the form of videos and images is being produced owning to advancements in sensor technology. Use of low performance commodity hardware coupled with resource heavy image processing and analyzing approaches to infer and extract actionable insights from this data poses a bottleneck for timely decision making. Current approach of GPU assisted and cloud-based architecture video analysis techniques give significant performance gain, but its usage is constrained by financial considerations and extremely complex architecture level details. In this paper we propose a data pipeline system that uses open-source tools such as Apache Spark, Kafka and OpenCV running over commodity hardware for video stream processing and image processing in a distributed environment.

To obtain the information needed to implement smart city services, stream reasoning is used to intelligently process the big data stream constantly generated from IoT devices. However, there are constraints associated with the real-time processing of large streams of big data from the smart city infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a stream reasoning system model for the smart city application, which was implemented using real-time big data processing technology in the smart city middleware. We use Apache Kafka, a message processing system, and Apache Storm, a real-time distributed processing system, to overcome the constraints associated with real-time processing. We evaluate the performance of our system implementation by measuring the throughput per second and the maximum capacity of the experimental system.

DTs use data gathered from the sensory systems on production lines to predict failures of machinery, optimize the quality of the products, and reduce the ecological footprint from facilities. They can be described as a sequence of jobs that perform required functionality linked together by a set of edges that represent data dependencies. To organize a flexible cloud computing support for the Digital Twin execution, we propose a concept of Micro-Workflows that combines the power of scientific workflows, the flexibility of containers technology, and robustness of the distributed streaming approach.

An application built on the microservices architecture relies on a collection of individual containerized components offering modular services via REST or gRPC interfaces over the network. Compared to a monolithic application, the magnitude of data and control exchange between the components of a microservices application is several orders higher. Studies have shown that overheads caused by such inter-container communication are a significant hurdle in achieving the sub-50ms latencies required for 5G enabled network Edges comprised of a much smaller compute cluster, unlike the Cloud. In this paper, we present Shimmy - a shared memory-based communication interface for containers that is cleanly integrated into the Kubernetes orchestration architecture while offering significant acceleration for microservices. Results have shown a consistent 3-4x latency improvement over UDP and TCP, as much as 20x latency improvement over RabbitMQ, while significantly reducing memory and CPU usage in large data transfers as well as real-time video streaming.

One common aim is to provide systems able to synchronize these devices, handle the big amount of daily generated data and meet business demands. This paper proposes a cost-effective cloud-based architecture using an event-driven backbone to process many applications' data in real-time, called REDA. It supports the Amazon Web Service (AWS) IoT core, and it opens the door as a free software-based implementation. Measured data from several wireless sensor nodes are transmitted to the cloud running application through the lightweight publisher/subscriber messaging transport protocol, MQTT. The real-time stream processing platform, Apache Kafka, is used as a message broker to receive data from the producer and forward it to the correspondent consumer. Micro-services design patterns, as an event consumer, are implemented with Java spring and managed with Apache Maven to avoid the monolithic applications' problem. The Apache Kafka cluster co-located with Zookeeper is deployed over three availability zones and optimized for high throughput and low latency. To guarantee no message loss and to simulate the system performances, different load tests are carried out. The proposed architecture is reliable in stress cases and can handle records goes to 8000 messages in a second with low latency in a cheap hosted and configured architecture.

In this paper we propose a distributed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based ensemble learning architecture for learning highly nonlinear, temporal fault classification boundaries for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). The main goal of the architecture is to reduce classification bias by ensembling LSTM models as well as achieving near-real time processing time. This is done by parallelizing the deep learning models on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud instances via Apache Kafka, a real-time data pipelining infrastructure. An experiment is conducted on a UGV subjected to dislocated suspension faults and results showing the effectiveness of the approach are shown.

In this evolving ecosystem, the demand for a seamless end-to-end system becomes paramount for enhancing operational efficiency and safety. Hence, this study introduces an innovative method for real-time driver identification by integrating cloud computing with deep learning. Utilizing the integrated capabilities of Google Cloud, Thingsboard, and Apache Kafka, the developed solution tailored for IoV technology is adept at managing real-time data collection, processing, prediction, and visualization, with resilience against sensor data anomalies. Also, this research suggests an appropriate method for driver identification by utilizing a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and multi-head self-attention in the proposed approach. The proposed model is validated on two datasets: Security and collected. Moreover, the results show that the proposed model surpassed the previous works by achieving an accuracy and F1 score of 99.95%. Even when challenged with data anomalies, this model maintains a high accuracy of 96.2%. By achieving accurate driver identification results, the proposed end-to-end IoV system can aid in optimizing fleet management, vehicle security, personalized driving experiences, insurance, and risk assessment. This emphasizes its potential for road safety and managing transportation more effectively.

The main challenge faced by the task scheduler is to identify the optimal resources for the input task. In this research, a Sine Cosine-based Elephant Herding Optimization (SCEHO) algorithm is incorporated with the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm for enhancing the task scheduling behavior by utilizing parameters like load balancing and resource allocation. The conventional EHO and PSO algorithms are improved utilizing a sine cosine-based clan-updating operator and human group optimizer that improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation abilities and avoid being trapped in the local optima problem. The efficacy of the SCEHO-IPSO algorithm is analyzed by using performance measures like cost, execution time, makespan, latency, and memory storage. The numerical investigation indicates that the SCEHO-IPSO algorithm has a minimum memory storage of 309 kb, a latency of 1510 ms, and an execution time of 612 ms on the Kafka platform, and the obtained results reveal that the SCEHO-IPSO algorithm outperformed other conventional optimization algorithms. The SCEHO-IPSO algorithm converges faster than the other algorithms in the large search spaces, and it is appropriate for large scheduling issues.

These applications are typically based on the development of web service and web application. Even though web-based technology offers effective communication and implementation, it has been susceptible to various kinds of attack. In this paper, we investigate possible attacks on REST which is a commonly used protocol for the web service implementation. In REST, HTTP requests are mapped to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE that have been proven to be prone to common attacks including Automated Brute Forcing on web-based login, HTTP flood attacks, SQL injections (SQLi), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To this end, we propose a design and implementation of the cloud-based IDS to detect such attacks by employing Apache Kafka and Spark streaming to classify and process the high volume of user inputs in REST HTTP communication. To detect the anomalous inputs, we apply the signature-based approach to construct an IDS engine based on a set of known attack patterns that will be leveraged by the Spark Streaming. Specifically, we introduce a new string comparison collection that improves the False Positive (FP) rate in SQL injection detection, which has been a major issue in most proposed IDS currently available. In our experiment, the system is able to determine malicious patterns with high performance as well as to generate SMS alerts and log the event in a Google Cloud Storage Bucket in an efficient manner.

Reactive microservices consist of isolated components in an event stream that can react independently or in concert with other microservices to arrive at the final states of the event. In this paper, we present a microservice architecture which is based on event streams and has a decentralized framework for microservice coordination. The architecture allows microservices to enrich content in an event stream without any time or mobility constraints. Final states are construed as acceptable and incrementally stackable for event updates that occur at different time slots. The event coordinator platform establishes the coordination within a microservice using the event registry. We present how we horizontally scaled the platform with multiple parallelism strategies and show the platform performance results.

Such ML algorithms can be represented as operators and dynamically adapted based on the resources on which they are hosted. Deploying ML algorithms on edge resources often focuses on carrying out inference on the edge, while learning and model development takes place on a cloud data center. In this article, we describe TinyMOA, a modified version of the open-source massive online analytics library for stream processing, that can be deployed across both local and remote edge resources using the Parsl and Kafka systems. Using an experimental testbed, we demonstrate how ML stream-processing operators can be configured based on the resource on which they are hosted, and discuss subsequent implications for edge-based stream-processing systems.

Hadoop and some other cloud computing technologies make batch processing possible to process big data. Storm is like a real-time Hadoop. Storm model is easy, but it's difficult to deal with complex Topology due to the increasing inter-dependences between components. This paper proposes a novel method which simplifies the Storm Topology programming model by combining Spring with Storm. It provide a modular approach and a unified configuration model to build topologies and easy to use API for using Storm. Meanwhile, this paper propose a system to process data and realize the K-Means clustering algorithm in Storm. The practice results is shown and analyzed to prove the effectiveness of the system and model, at the same time it proves that Storm can improve the clustering algorithm processing speed.

J	Yang, DG; Li, M; Liu, H				Yang, Dongou; Li, Mei; Liu, Hui			A Parallel Computing Algorithm for the Emergency-Oriented Atmospheric Dispersion Model CALPUFF	ATMOSPHERE				Article						atmospheric dispersion model; CALPUFF; parallel computing; model acceleration; emergency response		The calculation of the three-dimensional atmospheric dispersion model is often time-consuming, which makes the model difficult to apply to the emergency field. With the aim of addressing this problem, we propose a parallel computing algorithm for the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model. Existing methods for parallelizing the atmospheric dispersion model can be divided into two categories, with one using the parallel computing interface to rewrite the source code and the other directly dividing the repetitive elements in the computation task. This paper proposes an improved method based on the latter approach. Specifically, the method of spatial division with buffers is adopted to parallelize the wind field module of the CALPUFF model system, and the method for receptor layering is adopted to parallelize the dispersion module. In addition, the message queue software RabbitMQ is used as the communication middleware. A performance test is conducted on nine computing nodes on the Alibaba Cloud Computing Platform for a single-source continuous emergency leak case. The results show that the division method with a buffer of ten cells is most suitable for the case above in order to maintain the balance between computation speed and accuracy. This reduces the computation time of the model to about one-sixth, which is of great significance for extending the atmospheric dispersion model to the emergency field.

Various SP stacks exist today, with applications ranging from IoT analytics to processing of payment transactions. The backbone of said stacks are Stream Processing Engines (SPEs), software packages offering a high-level programming model and scalable execution of data stream processing pipelines. SPEs have been traditionally developed to work inside a single datacenter, and optimised for speed. With the advent of Fog computing, however, the processing of data streams needs to be carried out over multiple geographically distributed computing sites: Data gets typically pre-processed close to where they are generated, then aggregated at intermediate nodes, and finally globally and persistently stored in the Cloud. SPEs were not designed to address these new scenarios. In this paper, we argue that large scale Fog-based stream processing should rely on the coordinated composition of geographically dispersed SPE instances. We propose an architecture based on the composition of multiple SPE instances and their communication via distributed message brokers. We introduce SPECK, a tool to automate the deployment and adaptation of pipelines over a Fog computing platform. Given a description of the pipeline, SPECK covers all the operations needed to deploy a stream processing computation over the different SPE instances targeted, using their own APIs and establishing the required communication channels to forward data among them. A prototypical implementation of SpecK is presented, and its performance is evaluated over Grid'5000, a large-scale, distributed experimental facility.

However, energy management within and across microgrids is complicated due to many uncertainties such as imprecise knowledge on energy production and demand, which makes energy optimization challenging. In this paper, we present an open architecture that uses machine learning algorithms at the edge to predict energy consumption and production for energy management in smart microgrids. Such predictions are aggregated across different prosumers at a centralized marketplace in the Cloud using Kafka Streams and OpenSource IoT platforms. Using pluggable optimization algorithms, different microgrids can implement different strategies for real-time optimal energy schedules. The proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of scalability and accuracy of predictions. Our heuristics can effectively optimize medium-sized microgrids.

At the same time, there are underutilized computing resources within cities and local edge-computing deployments. Using these slack resources may enable significantly lower pricing than comparable cloud computing; such resources would incur minimal marginal expenditure since their deployment and operation are mostly sunk costs. However, there are challenges associated with using these resources. First, they are not effectively aggregated or provisioned. Second, there is a lack of trust between customers and suppliers of computing resources, given that they are distinct stakeholders and behave according to their own interests. Third, delays in processing inputs may diminish the value of the applications. To resolve these challenges, we introduce an architecture combining a distributed trusted computing mechanism, such as a blockchain, with an efficient messaging system like Apache Pulsar. Using this architecture, we design a decentralized computation market where customers and suppliers make offers to deploy and host applications. The proposed architecture can be realized using any trusted computing mechanism that supports smart contracts, and any messaging framework with the necessary features. This combination ensures that the market is robust without incurring the input processing delays that limit other blockchain based solutions. We evaluate the market protocol using game-theoretic analysis to show that deviation from the protocol is discouraged. Finally, we assess the performance of a prototype implementation based on experiments with a streaming computer-vision application.

In many cases, cloud resources are used for such processing, exploiting their flexibility, but these sensor streaming applications often need to support operational and control actions that have real-time and low-latency requirements that go beyond the cost effective and flexible solutions supported by existing cloud frameworks, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, or Map-Reduce Streams. In this paper, we describe a model-driven and stepwise refinement methodological approach for streaming applications executed over clouds. The central role is assigned to a set of Petri Net models for specifying functional and non-functional requirements. They support model reuse, and a way to combine formal analysis, simulation, and approximate computation of minimal and maximal boundaries of non-functional requirements when the problem is either mathematically or computationally intractable. We show how our proposal can assist developers in their design and implementation decisions from a performance perspective. Our methodology allows to conduct performance analysis: The methodology is intended for all the engineering process stages, and we can (i) analyse how it can be mapped onto cloud resources, and (ii) obtain key performance indicators, including throughput or economic cost, so that developers are assisted in their development tasks and in their decision taking. In order to illustrate our approach, we make use of the pipelined wavefront array. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ANALYTICS; MODEL; RISK	This work presents the evolution of a solution for predictive maintenance to a Big Data environment. The proposed adaptation aims for predicting failures on wind turbines using a data-driven solution deployed in the cloud and which is composed by three main modules. (i) A predictive model generator which generates predictive models for each monitored wind turbine by means of Random Forest algorithm. (ii) A monitoring agent that makes predictions every 10 minutes about failures in wind turbines during the next hour. Finally, (iii) a dashboard where given predictions can be visualized. To implement the solution Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Mesos and HDFS have been used. Therefore, we have improved the previous work in terms of data process speed, scalability and automation. In addition, we have provided fault-tolerant functionality with a centralized access point from where the status of all the wind turbines of a company localized all over the world can be monitored, reducing O&M costs.

However, integrating state-of-the-art blockchain platforms with the scalable, enterprise-level applications result in several challenges. Current blockchain platforms do not support high transaction throughput, lack high scalability, and cannot provide real-time transaction processing and back-pressure operation handling in high transaction throughput applications (e.g Big data, IoT). In this paper, we propose a novel permissioned blockchain platform "Rahasak"for highly scalable, enterprise applications. Rahasak blockchain adopts the Apache Kafka-based consensus on top of a "Validate-Execute-Group"blockchain architecture to handle real-time transaction execution on the blockchain. The architecture is equipped with a functional programming and actor-based smart contract platform that enables concurrent execution of transactions in the blockchain. Rahasak supports high transaction throughput, high scalability, concurrent transaction execution, data analytics features. With Rahasak, we make blockchain more scalable, secure, structured and meaningful for further data analytics.

In a traditional approach, data collection method for unmanned sensors is not flexible and it has various limitations when it is dealt with the humongous volume of data. To address this, we propose a cloud data framework for sensing, securing and maintaining the sensors from cloud for surveillance and take quick decision based on the input. The another main intention of this framework is to enhance the system throughput, reduce the man power and cost by leveraging unmanned sensors and all integrated sensors. In order to meet the above, we create a platform to support in all levels, such as infrastructure, network and software to simplify the processes and services.

Often brokers, or intermediaries nodes, combined with the publish/subscribe communication model represent one of the most used strategies to enable Internet of Things applications. At scalability viewpoint, cloud computing and its main feature named resource elasticity appear as an alternative to solve the use of over-provisioned clusters, which normally present a fixed number of resources. However, we perceive that today the elasticity and Pub/Sub duet presents several limitations, mainly related to application rewrite, single cloud elasticity limited to one level and false-positive resource reorganization actions. Aiming at bypassing the aforesaid problems, this article proposes Brokel, a multi-level elasticity model for Pub/Sub brokers. Users, things, and applications use Brokel as a centralized messaging service broker, but in the back-end the middleware provides better performance and cost (used resourcesxperformance) on message delivery using virtual machine (VM) replication. Our scientific contribution regards the multi-level, orchestrator, and broker, and the addition of a geolocation domain name system service to define the most suitable entry point in the Pub/Sub architecture. Different execution scenarios and metrics were employed to evaluate a Brokel prototype using VMs that encapsulate the functionalities of Mosquitto and RabbitMQ brokers. The obtained results were encouraging in terms of application time, message throughput, and cost (application timexresource usage) when comparing elastic and non-elastic executions.

State-of-the-art Web Application Frameworks (WAFs) do not offer complete scaling concepts with automatic resource-provisioning, elastic caching or guaranteed maximum response times. These functionalities, however, are supported by cloud computing and needed to scale an application to its demands. Components like proxies, load-balancers, distributed caches, queuing and messaging systems have been around for a long time and in each field relevant research exists. Nevertheless, to create a scalable web service it is seldom enough to deploy only one component. In this work we propose to combine those complementary components to a predictable, composed system. The proposed solution introduces a novel class of web frameworks called Web Scaling Frameworks (WSFs) that take over the scaling. The proposed mathematical model allows a universally applicable prediction of performance in the single-machine-and multi-machine scope. A prototypical implementation is created to empirically validate the mathematical model and demonstrates both the feasibility and increase of performance of a WSF. The results show that the application of a WSF can triple the requests handling capability of a single machine and additionally reduce the number of total machines by 44%.

This is a functionality that can be incorporated within particular online scenarios in which the processed information needs to be traceable and proved genuine. The solution for the digital certification of (text-type) contents available online (OCC) consists of two elements that complement each other: the Portal which represents a web interface through which users interact with the system and the Portal. API which implements the actual logic ensuring the necessary functionalities. Given the existence of a set of microservices that expose certain basic functionalities, the Portal.API component will use them (by transmitting operation request events and consuming response events through the central communication component - which is a Kafka-based event bus), thus becoming independent of their implementation. With this approach, the established functionalities are decomposed into smaller functionalities, already exposed by microservices in the cloud-based middleware architecture, and so, the Portal.API has the exclusive role of using and integrating them. Next, the most important UML diagrams associated with the Portal.API component will be presented. They contain the logic on which the certification service for content available online is based.

However, the automated deployment of multi-VM platforms on various clouds leveraging on such reference architectures may raise several issues. The paper focuses particularly on the widespread Apache Spark Big Data platform as the baseline and the Occopus cloud-agnostic orchestrator tool. The set of new generation reference architectures are configurable by human-readable descriptors according to available resources and cloud-providers, and offers various components such as Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, HDFS, and Kafka. These pre-configured reference architectures can be automatically deployed even by the data scientist on-demand, using a multi-cloud approach for a wide range of cloud systems like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, OpenNebula, CloudSigma, etc. Occopus enables the scaling of cluster-oriented components (such as Spark) of the instantiated reference architectures. The presented solution was successfully used in the Hungarian Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) by the Institute for Political Science to classify newspaper articles.

The idea of the microservices architecture is to use a collection of loosely coupled services to compose a large-scale software application. In traditional monolithic architecture, by contrast, every piece of code is put together, and the application is developed, tested, and deployed as a single application. Obviously, it is challenging for the traditional architecture to scale properly. In this research, we implemented a social data analytics platform based on the microservices architecture over DC/OS. Specifically, our data analytics service is built by composing many open-source software including Spark, Kafka, and Node.js. On streaming processing, our platform offers a visual interface to show the hottest hashtags of the most popular user posts from an online forum. On batch processing, our platform is able to show the statistics such the top-10 liked or commented posts and the gender counts of the posters. The experimental results show that our data analytics platform can do streaming processing and batch processing successfully and reveal useful analytical results.

QuakeFlow: a scalable machine-learning-based earthquake monitoring workflow with cloud computing	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL				Article						Machine learning; Cloud computing; Computational seismology; Earthquake source observations	KILAUEA-VOLCANO; MAGMA TRANSPORT; DEEP	Earthquake monitoring workflows are designed to detect earthquake signals and to determine source characteristics from continuous waveform data. Recent developments in deep learning seismology have been used to improve tasks within earthquake monitoring workflows that allow the fast and accurate detection of up to orders of magnitude more small events than are present in conventional catalogues. To facilitate the application of machine-learning algorithms to large-volume seismic records at scale, we developed a cloud-based earthquake monitoring workflow, QuakeFlow, which applies multiple processing steps to generate earthquake catalogues from raw seismic data. QuakeFlow uses a deep learning model, PhaseNet, for picking P/S phases and a machine learning model, GaMMA, for phase association with approximate earthquake location and magnitude. Each component in QuakeFlow is containerized, allowing straightforward updates to the pipeline with new deep learning/machine learning models, as well as the ability to add new components, such as earthquake relocation algorithms. We built QuakeFlow in Kubernetes to make it auto-scale for large data sets and to make it easy to deploy on cloud platforms, which enables large-scale parallel processing. We used QuakeFlow to process three years of continuous archived data from Puerto Rico within a few hours, and found more than a factor of ten more events that occurred on much the same structures as previously known seismicity. We applied Quakeflow to monitoring earthquakes in Hawaii and found over an order of magnitude more events than are in the standard catalogue, including many events that illuminate the deep structure of the magmatic system. We also added Kafka and Spark streaming to deliver real-time earthquake monitoring results. QuakeFlow is an effective and efficient approach both for improving real-time earthquake monitoring and for mining archived seismic data sets.

To address this gap, we engineer a modular edge cloud computing system architecture that is built on latest advances in containerization techniques, including Kafka, for data streaming, Docker, as application platform, and Firebase Cloud, as realtime database system. We benchmark the performance of the system in terms of scalability, resource utilization and latency by comparing three scenarios: cloud-only, edge-only and combined edge-cloud. The measurements show that edge-only solution outperforms other scenarios only when deployed with data located at one edge only, i.e., without edge computing wide data synchronization. In case of applications requiring data synchronization through the cloud, edge-cloud scales around a factor 10 times better than cloudonly, until certain number of concurrent users in the system, and above this point, cloud-only scales better. In terms of resource utilization, we observe that whereas the mean utilization increases linearly with the number of user requests, the maximum values for the memory and the network I/O heavily increase when with an increasing amount of data.

J	Johnson, CE				Johnson, Caryl Erin			Beyond Earthworm: Keeping the Promise	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				Article								The founding of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) vision was originally presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1188 (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999), after many years of discussions and workshops, described in detail by Filson and Arabasz (2016). Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to "... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies." In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.

The approach, functionally validated on a testbed of clusters of low-cost off-the-shelf components, demonstrates that both real-time streaming processing and large-scale data analytics are feasible, with even completely avoiding the use of cloud layer. The fog layer uses advanced streaming and analytics paradigms, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Hadoop, to support the effective development of applications that use streaming, long-term data storage and analytics. As such, the platform is suitable for and is affordable for "private" users. Furthermore, we add to the platform intelligent edge layer that abstracts and can simulate the operation of the IoT-device layer in real time or can be directly connected to the IoT-device layer. The experiments on a real-life IoT-based smart parking application show that our two-tier approach is cost effective and scalable, and can handle simultaneously streaming processing and analytics tasks successfully.

Traditional techniques for network performance management have a limited ability to satisfy the network SLOs. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the fundamental reason comes from decoupling of the CPU scheduler and the network traffic controller as the current CPU scheduler is not aware of such network requirements but only provides a fair-share amount of CPU to all containers. Thus, the container cannot perform the amount of network processing as needed to satisfy its SLO when the CPU allocation is insufficient. In this article, we propose Autothrottle that dynamically adjusts the CPU allocation for the containers to satisfy their network SLOs. The key element of Autothrottle is a throttle algorithm that autonomously determines the amount of CPU for each container needed to satisfy the requirement. We implement Autothrottle in the Linux kernel and evaluate it with massive real-world workloads such as Apache Kafka. Our evaluation results show that Autothrottle successfully satisfies the given network SLO only with a 2% gap while the existing scheme achieves 20% less than the SLO. We further observe that Autothrottle also reduces the CPU overhead in network processing by 19%, improving the network throughput by 27% compared to the existing scheme.

These vast volumes of data need to he leveraged to improve patient care, optimize processes, and help health sector stakeholders and applications make faster and more informed decisions. Many healthcare applications use the power of the cloud for data processing. However, time-sensitive healthcare applications cannot tolerate sending data streams to the cloud for processing due to unacceptable high latency and network bandwidth requirements. Healthcare facilities and caregivers need the ability to efficiently stream data and process data streams in real-time at the edge. This paper describes a five-tier architecture that aims to deal with the streaming and processing of data generated by the various devices and equipment of healthcare facilities and systems to enable the creation of smart healthcare applications. The architecture is based on emerging and established technologies, including IoT, edge/fog, computing, data integration techniques, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed architecture will facilitate the creation of healthcare applications for real-time event detection, notification of alerts, and building monitoring dashboards. Fog node components include an advanced and widely recognized distributed messaging system, Apache Kafka, and the popular stream processing engine, Apache Storm, capable of processing large amounts of data.

Creating new algorithms that tap these architectural patterns and at the same time employ distributed resources efficiently is a challenge we will be taking up in this paper. We introduce KafkEO, a cloud-native evolutionary algorithms framework that is prepared to work with different implementations of evolutionary algorithms and other population-based metaheuristics by using micro-populations and stateless services as the main building blocks; KafkEO is an attempt to map the traditional evolutionary algorithm to this new cloud-native format. As far as we know, this is the first architecture of this kind that has been published and tested, and is free software and vendor-independent, based on OpenWhisk and Kafka. This paper presents a proof of concept, examines its cost, and tests the impact on the algorithm of the design around cloud-native and asynchronous system by comparing it on the well known BBOB benchmarks with other pool-based architectures, with which it has a remarkable functional resemblance. KafkEO results are quite competitive with similar architectures.	[Merelo Guervos, Juan J.] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Valdez, J.

J	Yuan, D; Yang, Y; Liu, XA; Chen, JJ				Yuan, Dong; Yang, Yun; Liu, Xiao; Chen, Jinjun			On-demand minimum cost benchmarking for intermediate dataset storage in scientific cloud workflow systems	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING				Article						Dataset storage; Scientific workflow; Cloud computing; Cost benchmarking	PROVENANCE	Many scientific workflows are data intensive: large volumes of intermediate datasets are generated during their execution. Some valuable intermediate datasets need to be stored for sharing or reuse. Traditionally, they are selectively stored according to the system storage capacity, determined manually. As doing science on clouds has become popular nowadays, more intermediate datasets in scientific cloud workflows can be stored by different storage strategies based on a pay-as-you-go model. In this paper, we build an intermediate data dependency graph (IDG) from the data provenances in scientific workflows. With the IDG, deleted intermediate datasets can be regenerated, and as such we develop a novel algorithm that can find a minimum cost storage strategy for the intermediate datasets in scientific cloud workflow systems. The strategy achieves the best trade-off of computation cost and storage cost by automatically storing the most appropriate intermediate datasets in the cloud storage. This strategy can be utilised on demand as a minimum cost benchmark for all other intermediate dataset storage strategies in the cloud. We utilise Amazon clouds' cost model and apply the algorithm to general random as well as specific astrophysics pulsar searching scientific workflows for evaluation. The results show that benchmarking effectively demonstrates the cost effectiveness over other representative storage strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some valuable intermediate data need to be stored for sharing or reuse. Traditionally, they are selectively stored according to the system storage capacity, determined manually. As doing science in the cloud has become popular nowadays, more intermediate data can be stored in scientific cloud workflows based on a pay-for-use model. In this paper, we build an intermediate data dependency graph (IDG) from the data provenance in scientific workflows. With the IDG, deleted intermediate data can be regenerated, and as such we develop a novel intermediate data storage strategy that can reduce the cost of scientific cloud workflow systems by automatically storing appropriate intermediate data sets with one cloud service provider. The strategy has significant research merits, i.e. it achieves a cost-effective trade-off of computation cost and storage cost and is not strongly impacted by the forecasting inaccuracy of data sets' usages. Meanwhile, the strategy also takes the users' tolerance of data accessing delay into consideration.

Since Hadoop was developed in 2007, new frameworks followed it such as Spark, Storm, Heron, Apex, Flink, Samza, Kafka...etc. Each framework is developed in a certain way to target and achieve certain objectives better than other frameworks do. However, there are few common functionalities and aspects that are shared between these frameworks. One vital aspect all these frameworks strive to achieve is better reliability and faster recovery time in case of failures. This is particularly crucial for streaming systems (compared to batch processing systems) where events are processed and monitored online in real time, and any delay in data delivery will cause a major inconvenience to the users. Another observation is that some reliability implementations are redundant between different frameworks. Encapsulating these implementations into one layer and make it shared between different applications will benefit more than one framework without the burden of re-implementing the same reliability approach in each single framework. These observations motivated us to present Warden, a generic, multi-framework, flexible, customizable, low overhead protocol to ensure the resiliency of streaming applications running on streaming Big Data frameworks. Most reliability protocols carry out one rigid fault tolerance approach targeted towards one system at a time. It is more challenging to provide a reliability approach that is pluggable in multiple Big Data frameworks at a time and can achieve low overheads comparable with single targeted framework approaches, yet is flexible and customizable by its users to make it tailored towards their objectives. The genericity is attained by providing an interface that can be used in different applications from different frameworks. The low overhead is achieved by providing faster application finish times with and without failures. The customizability is fulfilled by providing the users the options to choose between two delivery semantics (Exactly Once / At Most Once) combined with two fault tolerance guarantees (Crash Failures / Byzantine Failures). To the best of our knowledge, such approach was never tried on multiple streaming frameworks before. We built a prototype of Warden on Flink and Samza (with Kafka) streaming frameworks. Our evaluations highlight the effectiveness of our approach in the presence of failures and without failures compared to other fault tolerance techniques (such as checkpointing).

Analytic Study of Containerizing Stateful Stream Processing as Microservice to Support Digital Twins in Fog Computing	PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE				Article							ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHM; MIGRATION	Digital twins of processes and devices use information from sensors to synchronize their state with the entities of the physical world. The concept of stream computing enables effective processing of events generated by such sensors. However, the need to track the state of an instance of the object leads to the impossibility of organizing instances of digital twins as stateless services. Another feature of digital twins is that several tasks implemented on their basis require the ability to respond to incoming events at near-real-time speed. In this case, the use of cloud computing becomes unacceptable due to high latency. Fog computing manages this problem by moving some computational tasks closer to the data sources. One of the recent solutions providing the development of loosely coupled distributed systems is a Microservice approach, which implies the organization of the distributed system as a set of coherent and independent services interacting with each other using messages. The microservice is most often isolated by utilizing containers to overcome the high overheads of using virtual machines. The main problem is that microservices and containers together are stateless by nature. The container technology still does not fully support live container migration between physical hosts without data loss. It causes challenges in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of services in fog computing environments. Thus, an essential challenge is to create a containerized stateful stream processing based microservice to support digital twins in the fog computing environment. Within the scope of this article, we study live stateful stream processing migration and how to redistribute computational activity across cloud and fog nodes using Kafka middleware and its Stream DSL API.

Remote access of appliances and devices in a home is provided via the internet. The challenge lies in making the system smart and deployable in a scalable manner across an entire city in a developing nation. This paper proposes a framework for making home automation achievable across a smart city in a scalable and data efficient manner. We have proposed an end to end home automation suite with modular implementation using open source components. The backend implemented supports multiple IoT protocols and the system is horizontally scalable. The 'Rules engine' implemented analyzes the data real time thus triggering various actions pre-decided by users. The system involves energy monitoring for enabling judicial energy consumption in a home. Unlike smart-meters, which give data about total energy consumption per house, the proposed solution is an innovative way to get fairly accurate analysis of per device consumption. A single system can be deployed and can handle data coming from homes for an entire city. The implemented system includes web-dashboard and android application for monitoring the consumption. The scalable architecture used ensures that there will be no problem handling data traffic as number of users increase. Experiments on the prototype system showed low latency for real time analytics even with large simultaneous data streams. The unique features of this system are its modular & dynamic nature, scalability and real time analytics for quick decision making.

To maintain a stable Quality of Service (QoS), these systems require a sufficient allocation of resources. At the same time, over-provisioning can result in wasted energy and high operating costs. Therefore, to maximize resource utilization, autoscaling methods have been proposed that aim to efficiently match the resource allocation with the incoming workload. However, determining when and by how much to scale remains a significant challenge. Given the long-running nature of DSP jobs, scaling actions need to be executed at runtime, and to maintain a good QoS, they should be both accurate and infrequent. To address the challenges of autoscaling, the concept of self-adaptive systems is particularly fitting. These systems monitor themselves and their environment, adapting to changes with minimal need for expert involvement. This paper introduces Daedalus, a self-adaptive manager for autoscaling in DSP systems, which draws on the principles of self-adaption to address the challenge of efficient autoscaling. Daedalus monitors a running DSP job and builds performance models, aiming to predict the maximum processing capacity at different scaleouts. When combined with time series forecasting to predict future workloads, Daedalus proactively scales DSP jobs, optimizing for maximum throughput and minimizing both latencies and resource usage. We conducted experiments using Apache Flink and Kafka Streams to evaluate the performance of Daedalus against two state-of-the-art approaches. Daedalus was able to achieve comparable latencies while reducing resource usage by up to 71%.	[Pfister, Benjamin J.

High neonatal mortality is a prominent and persistent problem across the globe. Non-availability of trained staff and infrastructure are the major recognized hurdles in the quality care of these neonates. Hourly progress growth charts and reports are still maintained manually by nurses along with continuous calculation of drug dosage and nutrition as per the changing weight of the baby. iNICU (integrated Neonatology Intensive Care Unit) leverages Beaglebone and Intel Edison based IoT integration with biomedical devices in NICU i.e. monitor, ventilator and blood gas machine. iNICU is hosted on IBM Softlayer based cloud computing infrastructure and map NICU workflow in Java based responsive web application to provide translational research informatics support to the clinicians. iNICU captures real time vital parameters i.e. respiration rate, heart rate, lab data and PACS amounting for millions of data points per day per child. Stream of data is sent to Apache Kafka layer which stores the same in Apache Cassandra NoSQL. iNICU also captures clinical data like feed intake, urine output, and daily assessment of child in PostgreSQL database. It acts as first Big Data hub (of both structured and unstructured data) of neonates across India offering temporal (longitudinal) data of their stay in NICU and allow clinicians in evaluating efficacy of their interventions. iNICU leverages drools based clinical rule based engine and deep learning based big data analytical model coded in R and PMML. iNICU solution aims to improve care time, fills skill gap, enable remote monitoring of neonates in rural regions, assists in identifying the early onset of disease, and reduction in neonatal mortality.

J	Li, ZH; Chen, TH; Yang, JQ; Shang, WY				Li, Zhenhao; Chen, Tse-Hsun; Yang, Jinqiu; Shang, Weiyi			Studying Duplicate Logging Statements and Their Relationships With Code Clones	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING				Article						Cloning; Manuals; Tools; Static analysis; Maintenance engineering; Java; Cloud computing; Log; code smell; duplicate log; code clone; static analysis; empirical study	SOFTWARE; CCFINDER; SMELLS; BUGS	Developers rely on software logs for a variety of tasks, such as debugging, testing, program comprehension, verification, and performance analysis. Despite the importance of logs, prior studies show that there is no industrial standard on how to write logging statements. In this paper, we focus on studying duplicate logging statements, which are logging statements that have the same static text message. Such duplications in the text message are potential indications of logging code smells, which may affect developers' understanding of the dynamic view of the system. We manually studied over 4K duplicate logging statements and their surrounding code in five large-scale open source systems: Hadoop, CloudStack, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and Flink. We uncovered five patterns of duplicate logging code smells. For each instance of the duplicate logging code smell, we further manually identify the potentially problematic (i.e., require fixes) and justifiable (i.e., do not require fixes) cases. Then, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated our manual study result and developers' feedback into our automated static analysis tool, DLFinder, which automatically detects problematic duplicate logging code smells. We evaluated DLFinder on the five manually studied systems and three additional systems: Camel, Kafka and Wicket. In total, combining the results of DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate logging code smell instances to developers and all of them have been fixed. We further study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including the problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We find that 83 percent of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned code, but 17 percent of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using automated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the duplicate logging statements reside in cloned code snippets, and a large portion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively detected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in addition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones may also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance difficulties.
