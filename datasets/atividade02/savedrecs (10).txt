AB Sleep monitoring using polysomnography (PSG) in hospitals can be considered expensive, so the preferable way is to use contactless and wearable sensors to monitor sleep daily by patients at home. In this study, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform was utilized for sleep monitoring with contactless or wearable sensors as an integrated system developed based on an event-driven and microservice architecture. Multiple services that respond to events are provided within the system. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data were used as the input in the sleep monitoring system. The combination of the weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to process the ECG data, followed by fuzzy logic to measure sleep quality, then display the data on the dashboard. Based on the experimental results, the proposed architecture increased throughput by 34.76%, decreased response time by 55.85%, and reduced memory consumption by 37.26% per instance replication compared to the non-event-driven architecture. The accuracies of the sleep stage classification were 78.78% and 73.09% for the three and four classes, respectively, and the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reached 0.89 for both the three and four class classifications.

AB Digital technologies are reshaping our world and are becoming an integral part of our being. It became obvious that in modern days digitalization in each industry is an irreversible process and the speed of adopting of such kind of technologies in an appropriate manner will determine the evolution and survival of any business. Digital technologies play a crucial role in any domain of our life: from simple everyday activities, to such important domains like security, safety and health. We are the witnesses of so-called "Industry 4.0 Revolution" which is dominated by Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Architectures with related technologies. When we think about big change or (r)evolution, we are looking mostly for advantages only, but don't care about challenges and what is happening under the hood.
   The truth is that "reality is distributed" and the things are getting more complex with each passing day. The information systems are dealing with more and more (huge) amount of data, nevertheless, a quick response (in milliseconds) is expected and no downtime is accepted. In this context, the challenges consist first of all in designing and implementing a reliable (doing well what it was designed for), performant (quick reaction time), low-overhead (non-blocking and optimal use of resources) and flexible (adding new features with minimal effect upon production environment) systems. To implement a system with such kind of features a specific programming models need to be used.
   In this paper is proposed an architectural approach aimed to ensure scalability and extensibility of a distributed information systems using not fresh, but still very actual concept like Actor Model and REST. Modern Event-Driven, Asynchronous and non-blocking programming models are used.

AB This article explores the world of dependable systems, specifically focusing on system design, software solutions, and architectural decisions that facilitate collaborative work on shared text documents across multiple users in near real time. It aims to dive into the intricacies of designing robust and effective document collaboration software focusing on understanding the requirements of such a system, the working principle of collaborative text editing, software architecture, technology stack selection, and tooling that can sustain such a system. To examine the pros and cons of the proposed system, the paper will detail how collaborative text editing software can benefit from such an architecture regarding availability, elasticity, and scaling. The intricate nature of this system renders this paper a valuable resource for prospective investigations within the domain of dependable systems and distributed systems. This research first examines the requirements of a real-time collaboration system and the necessary core features. Then, it analyzes the design, the application structure, and the system organization while also considering key architectural requirements as the necessity of scaling, the usage of microservices, cross-service communications, and client-server communication. For the technology stack of the implementation, this research considers the alternatives at each layer, from client to server. Once these decisions are made, it follows system development while examining possible improvements for the issues previously encountered. To validate the architecture, a testing strategy is developed, to examine the key capabilities of the system, such as resource consumption and throughput. The conclusions review the combination of modern and conventional application development principles needed to address the challenges of conflict-free document replication, decoupled and stateless event-driven architecture, idempotency, and data consistency. This paper not only showcases the design and implementation process but also sets a foundation for future research and innovation in dependable systems, collaborative technologies, sustainable solutions, and distributed system architecture.
